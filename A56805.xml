            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Epiſtle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is as much in the Reader's power to read or to forbear with Contempt, as to buy or not to buy: He knows that I, and the Book-ſeller can't impoſe upon him: if he overlook, or deſpiſe me, he ſaves both his Mony and his Time, and he may ſpare his Cenſures of Affectation or any other Fault, except be certainly know it, with as much Kindneſs to himſelf, as Juſtice to me. I owe ſuch Men no account of my ſelf, or of the Multiplication of theſe Pleas; but they that will be pleaſed to read them, will accept the Reaſon of the Number, as well as the Thing. When I had written the firſt, I thought I had done with the Argument, except called upon to vindicate, or confirm, to explain, or to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect what requires Correction. But when I had ſaid all I thought fit to ſay, it was without any cauſe at all given by me, reported that I had written a Second Plea, and the Second Plea was enquired after before it was conceived in my Mind. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon notice of this, I conſidered if this might be an Invitation or Call to view, and to give my ſenſe of their Sufferings with reſpect to publick Benefit, by a Ceſſation of their many Troubles, and Liberty to preach the Goſpel. I was confined to Brevity in that which yet was too large for many. In it I did ſtate the Caſe as truly and diſtinctly as poſſibly I could, and laboured to inform the Reader, both hiſtorically and rationally: I looked upon the hiſtorieal Part as obſcure, becauſe ſhort; and upon the rational as too weak; wanting the Authority of Teſtimony, and conſent of the Eminent Writers of our Church. And becauſe I ſaw the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity of the Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cork,</hi> who drew my Eſtimation and Affection to him for his peaceable Deſign, as if the Sufferings of the Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts were artificially aggravated to an evil end, I thought three things neceſſary to be done: <hi>1.</hi> To run up to the Spring of our Diviſions in the <hi>Savoy</hi>-Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and gave ſome Hiſtorical Account of Church-Affairs before, and about that time, which I perceived many did not know. <hi>2.</hi> To ſhew and compare the Aſpects of ſome of our moſt Renowned Writers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and our Diſſenting Proteſtants towards the ſame things, of very great moment and tendency to Peace. <hi>3.</hi> To repreſent ſome of the many Sufferings of Divines of known Loyalty, meerly for Nonconformity, to this end, that their Sufferings might affect Authority, and incline Men's Minds to Mercy and Porbearance. For while their Sufferings are ſlighted, and their Cauſe deſpiſed, and odiouſly
<pb facs="tcp:102446:3"/>expoſed as it commonly is, there is no hope of Reconciliation, nor Abatement of their Sufferings, nor of any Conceſſions to make their Admiſſion eaſy and comfortable. And all this was done together, and referred to the ingenious and honeſt Bookſeller, who being the proper Judg of his own Affairs, concluded it beſt to divide the whole into two Parts; and ſo that which was a Supplement to the <hi>Second Plea,</hi> is called the <hi>Third,</hi> and that which was a part of the <hi>Third,</hi> is called the <hi>Fourth Plea.</hi> This account I thought good to give of the Number, to them who are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with the Argument, but with the Number. But it will be more difficult to ſatisfy them who are diſpleaſed with the Argument it ſelf. And of this I have here and there dropt a Reaſon, beſides a kind of Apology, in the Second, which I think took up too much room; and therefore I ſhall not run out here. My Deſign is throughly known to Him, whoſe Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, to whom I muſt give my laſt Account, and receive my final Judgment, after that Men have talkt and done their Pleaſure: I do humbly beg his Forgiveneſs for all Failings; and of Men, when any ſhall convince me of any Injury which I have ignorantly and unwillingly done, if any be done. I do verily believe the Argument is a needful Argument: and had the Management of it been anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to it's Importance, and by a better hand, I ſhould have more rejoyced to reade it, than now I can; but yet as it is, I do not repent that I have given my Teſtimony to the Servants of Chriſt, nor the Faith and Holineſs profeſſed and propagated by them, although ſome will make it as dear to me as they can. But they and I are in the hands of God, and for their ſakes I wiſh they would not be too bold and free of their Menaces.</p>
            <p>There is a noted Perſon, who affects the Title of <hi>Obſervator</hi> (I am ſure, either he is wilfully blind on one ſide, or he is abuſed by his Spectacles and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers) to whom I am indebted. I cannot paſs by his Obſervator upon the <hi>Third Plea, Numb. 172.</hi> Tory ſpeaks of the Plea; <hi>No, no, 'tis not ripe for violence yet, but he advances very fairly, by way of Preparatory to it, if he can but perſwade the Multitude that the five-Mile Act was fram'd and paſs'd by Papiſts. Here's the King now, and the Majority of both Houſes, expoſed to the Rabble, as a Popiſh Faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader, here's Obſervator now. Theſe Words <hi>[fram'd and paſſed by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts]</hi> are not mine, but his.</p>
            <p>There is a Doſe of his Ingenuity and Goodneſs wrapt up in the Inſinuation, as if I ſaid or meant, as he is bold to report. If I quote my Authors for what I ſaid, or produce my Teſtimonies, he will not abide me more than them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Parliament-Men. One worthy Member of the Houſe in the Debate about u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting Proteſtant Diſſenters, appealed to many Members then in the Houſe, who were in that Parliament, as remembring that Act was promoted by Sir <hi>Thomas Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Solomon Swale,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Strickland,</hi> who all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be Papiſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102446:3"/>
And I could name him ſome who remember the three Corners of the Houſe of Commons in which theſe three Popiſh Agents placed or poſted themſelves to ſee that the Votes of their Friends might not fail their Expectations, if not Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Three ſuch leading Men as theſe were in the Houſe, when thinner than uſual becauſe of the Plague, and being then diſguiſed, and afterwards open Papiſts, was enough to denominate a Popiſh Faction, and to carry what they contrived, eſpecially pretending a Service to the Church, and by that pretence drawing the unwary Proteſtant to vote the ſame way. The Act, and the Oath in the Act was oppoſed by the eminent Loyal Earl of <hi>Southampton</hi> Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, and others of the Nobility, and by the eminent Dr. <hi>Earl</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury;</hi> and when they of the other Party endeavoured to lay the ſame Oath upon the whole Kingdom, it was not only oppoſed by the Loyal, but carried in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by three Votes, which were the now Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Perigrine Bartue,</hi> who was that day introduced into the Houſe by the other two. And this is ſufficient to prove the other part of my Sentence, that it was oppoſed by the Loyal. It is the firſt time that I ever read or heard that the King fram'd or paſſed the Act: (the Acts are paſſed before they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him) or, which I abhor to think, to be in a Popiſh Faction, I leave the Scandal where I found it in <hi>Obſervator,</hi> with more of the ſame Dy and Tincture. Others there are that may be ſatisfied with the ſame Anſwers, who take it ill that it is remembred the five Mile Act was procured or promoted by Popiſh Counſels and Endeavours. Had not great and obſerving Men, who ſerved in Parliaments declared it; I ſhould not have laid any part of my Argument upon it, neither do I think a <hi>Quid pro Quo,</hi> to be an excuſe for me, if I had ſaid it, without ſufficient Teſtimony, that they who arraign and damn the Pleas, have given out that the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> was from the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and in favour of the Papiſts. The Kingdom was alarmed with the fears of Popery; and many Preachers were Lecturers upon the Controverſies againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, as if it had been at the Church doors, and all muſt be armed againſt it: His Majeſty took notice of it in his Gracious Speech of <hi>February 5. 1672.</hi> 
               <q>I put forth my Declaration for Indulgence to Diſſenters, and I have hitherto found the good Effect of it — There is one part in it which hath been ſubject to Miſconſtruction, which is that concerning the Papiſts, as if more Liberty were granted them, than to the other Recuſants, when it is plain there is leſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I do not intend it ſhall any ways prejudice the Church, but I will ſupport its Right, and it in its full Power. Having ſaid this, I ſhall take it very ill to receive Contradiction in what I have done; and I will deal plainly with you, I am reſolved to ſtick to my Declaration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellour alſo ſpake the ſame thing. <q>His Majeſty hath ſo fully vindicated his Declaration from that Calumny concerning the Papiſts, that no reaſonable Scruple can be made by any good Man: He hath ſufficiently juſtified
<pb facs="tcp:102446:4"/>it by the time it was publiſhed in, and the Effects he hath had from it; and might have done it more, from the agreeableneſs of it to his own natural Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which no good Engliſh Man can wiſh otherwiſe than it is: He loves not Blood, or rigorous Severities; but where mild or gentle ways may be uſed by a wiſe Prince, he is certain to chooſe them — and concludes that Head thus: But his Majeſty is not convinced that violent ways are the Intereſt of Religion, or the Church. <hi>p. 12, 13.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And the ſame Lord Chancellour, then a great Miniſter of State, gives his Reaſons to his Friend contrary to the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi>'s, why be ſhould think that Indulgence was a favour to the Proteſtant Diſſenters, and for the advantage of the Proteſtant Religion, which are printed in a Letter from a Perſon of Quality, <hi>p. 5.</hi> However, it is clear, many of our Proteſtant Brethren declared their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to Popery in their Learned Morning Exerciſes againſt Popery and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and do well know that one World cannot hold the Papiſts and them both, if Popery have Power; And our <hi>Mittimus</hi> will be quickly drawn, after that St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Succeſſor can come in <hi>Goaler,</hi> a Place he would purchaſe at any rate.</p>
            <p>But O! how much more happy were it for us to be reconciled, and made one by Chriſt, by his Spirit, by his Goſpel, than be made Friends by him that oppoſeth himſelf, and was known in <hi>England</hi> by the Name of Antichriſt, which he can never forget, nor digeſt? Diſcerning and good Men are under Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Sufferings coming upon us, and write their Preparations; one, a worthy Miniſter of our Church, for Martyrdom, others for Sufferings; and the excellent Mr. <hi>Polhill</hi> draws the Face and Aſpect of the Times with his curious Pen. <q>Charity is cold, Differences ar hot, Moderation vaniſhes, Enmity every where appears, Popery lifts up it ſelf in the World; Proteſtants help on the Deſign by deſtroying each other. Sin is gone up with a great Cry to Heaven; black Clouds of Wrath hang over our heads for it; the decays of holy Love threaten a remove of our Candleſticks; Lukewarmneſs in Religion ſhews, that we are fit to be ſpewed out of God's Mouth: Every one that hath eyes in his head may ſee the Tendency of ſuch things as theſe —. Epiſtle to the Reader before his <hi>Armatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Dei.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Peace is protracted by the Preſervation of One Life, upon which it hangs, <hi>which is more worth than ten thouſand of us (2 Sam. 18.3.)</hi> often won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully preſerved from open and latent dangers. But in how many Cities, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations and Counties is a Civil War begun! What Contrivances are ſtudied to divide us, and provocations to ſtrike? O who can number or expreſs the diviſion of Hearts amongst us! what Contentions in Pariſhes! what Inquiſitions after Diſſenters! They are once again become the Publick Grievance, and great Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Party to be ſuppreſſed. The Tide that roſe againſt <hi>Popery</hi> a few years ago, is turned upon them now: as ſome have obſerved it ſeveral times before to have
<pb facs="tcp:102446:4"/>done. Yea, they are not only driven out of their Meetings, but cannot in ſome Places, worſhip God in their own private Families without Spies, yea, more, without Moleſtation; Suſpected evil Deſigns can not be more narrowly watched, than they are, who fear and worſhip the God of Heaven. Hence Impiety takes great Boldneſs and Confidence, and Piety is ſhut up, and muſt neither be heard nor ſeen. I am credibly informed, it is thus for a Time (but how long?) in ſome Places, ſince wicked Man ſee they may take that Courſe, which ſcarce any but they will undertake. And this Way of Impiety to diſcountenance, terrify, and confine or baniſh true real Piety, is that which I ſpeak againſt, and direct my Diſcourſe to.</p>
            <p>I make not my ſelf wiſer than my Rulers, nor do oppoſe my ſelf againſt lawful Power, lawfully uſed by the meaneſt Officer; but being in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure affected with the great Piety of many of my Brethren, and their great Sufferings in many kinds, and the Proceedings of moſt Men againſt them. Nonconformity is but the Pretence; but it is the Gain of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ſhall never profit them, nor be bleſſed unto them, that is aimed at. Who can ſay, he was ever the better or the richer for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Loſſes of the Sufferers? It were happy for the Informers, if no worſe ſhould befall them in this World, (not to ſpeak of the World to come) than happened to two of them, who went to complain, or demand (or both) their Moyety of a Juſtice of Peace, who commanded them both to be ſet in the Stock. Some Inſtances of the temporal State of theſe kind of Men are given in the few following Narratives.</p>
            <p>Obſerve the Methods and Manner of the Execution, and the vaſt Diſſimilitude between their obſerving the Sabbath-Day, and the hunted Diſſenters. I do heartily wiſh all Things were done decently and in order in the Pbulick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and that thither might be the Way of all God's People with one conſent: But if that cannot be, without Controverſy, to worſhip God in Chriſt by one Spirit, to preach one Faith, to join in Praiſes, to celebrate Sacraments, are more like the Sanctification of the Name and Sabbaths of the Lord our God, than riding and running up and down with vain Words, Blaſtings, Threatnings and Oaths, in a Morning, to find out a Preacher, and the Afternoon in Exceſs and Riot.</p>
            <p>I remember that <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaid, The <hi>Papiſts</hi> were unfit Men to correct the <hi>Anabaptiſts; Correctionis non eſt opus, niſi verorum Chriſtianorum.</hi> As he ſaith, Papiſts may burn them, but cannot correct them, except Burning be Correction: So theſe Men may inform, diſtrain, buy and ſell the diſtrained Goods, and hale Nonconformiſts to Priſon; but is this to convince and reduce them? And tho others may have better Aims and Intentions than theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors have, yet is there not a more excellent Way? eſpecially in ſuch a Time as this, and in ſuch a Matter, wherein ſo much of the Glory of our Lord
<pb facs="tcp:102446:5"/>Jeſus is concerned. Let us fear, that to proſecute ſuch Men and Differences as intolerable do not bring upon us that which is really ſo.</p>
            <p>I have uſed ſome Means to inform my ſelf, and cannot find that there is one Sign of God's Approbation of ſuch a Courſe as this is. I have given a ſmall Handfull of Inſtances in the following Collection, from which much may be obſerved; and it is but a very little, not ſo much as a Gleaning would be, if all were written which might be. I have ſeen it under the Hand of a Reverend Divine, that it was the Conjecture of ſeveral Miniſters, that if the Hiſtory of the Sufferings of the Nonconformiſts were written, but in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> it would make a great <hi>Folio.</hi> O how much more neceſſary a Duty lies upon Men, of turning to the Lord from all their wicked Ways, of working out their own Salvation, and furthering the Salvation of one another, of following after Love, Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the black Day of Death, and the great Day of Judgment! and to be more ſtrict againſt open Sins, than controverted and tolerable Diſtinctions! But if they who are <hi>born after the Fleſh,</hi> will ſhew their Natures, and grow wanton in Peace and Plenty, and find none to inſult upon in their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Raptures, but thoſe that deſire to know and worſhip God in Fear; Let all thoſe who are <hi>born from above,</hi> and are Partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>as the Elect of God, holy and beloved, put on Bowels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing one another: And if any Man have a Quarrel againſt any, even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye: And above all theſe things, put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if other Places will not afford Reſt and Quietneſs for peaceable and honeſt good Men, that differ in a few Things; let not <hi>London</hi> forget their Labours, who ventured their Lives (with other good Men) to ſave, and to make Interceſſions for them, in the dreadful Plague; nor them who lay in the Duſt, pouring out Prayers for them, when Ruines lay inſtead of ſtately Piles, who have been eminently ſerviceable to reclaim diſſolute Youth, and promote Piety and Goodneſs. And why may not good Men, of different Notions and Perſuaſions in Modes and Forms, live together in Peace and Love, converſe with mutual Confidence and Dearneſs, as well as trade, and maintain Commerce with Perſons and Nations of a contrary Religion?</p>
            <p>But I muſt conclude. The Lord proſper what I have in much Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity endeavoured for the Glory of God, and his Truth, the Honour of the King, and the Peace and Tranquillity of the Kingdom. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>THE <hi>Conformiſt's fourth Plea</hi> FOR THE Nonconformiſts.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>NION is that which all wiſe, good and gracious Souls muſt needs deſire, and endeavour to attain, as they endeavour the attainment of Happineſs, which conſiſteth in it. Our Diviſions are extreme painful and uncomfortable; a great Diſhonour and Impediment to Religion, and Communion of Saints. Every Motion and Propoſal for it deſerves Attention and Thanks, tho it cannot be embraced or aſſented to. And whatſoever tends to make, continue, and widen our Diviſions, ſhould conſcienciouſly be avoided. Rigorous execting of abateable Articles and Terms, Prejudices, Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſtraining of Conſequences, aggravating Offences, odious Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Perſons, Strangeneſs; refuſing to do Offices of Kindneſs, Juſtice, and Mercy; diſingenuous Cenſures, provoking Speeches, and Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, are Wedges of Diviſion: beſides other wounding and cutting warlike Inſtruments, and Proceedings of Eccleſiaſtical Hoſtility. As it was from Hardneſs of Heart, that the Jews put away their Wives for every cauſe; ſo it proceeds not from Tenderneſs of Heart, that our Brethren are put away, as incurable Schiſmaticks, for every Diſſent and Diſagreement, Peace, Love, and Forbearance have a greater Place aſſigned them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than the Things in Controverſy, which cauſe our Diviſion. And whether it be meeteſt for the greater Things to ſuffer by the leſſer, or the leſſer to give place to the greater, let common Reaſon judg, and common
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102446:6"/>Experience come in as Evidence; eſpecially in a time when we ſee Religion wounded in Head and Heart, and it can never recover Health, Strength, and Beauty, as long as theſe Wounds lie open. Unite we muſt, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this disjointed broken Condition, and grow worſe and worſe by the application of Force and Warrants. The evil Conſequences of this Courſe are many and great. 1. The Law of Love and Dearneſs is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. 2. The Diſſenters, in their Judgment, will never want a ſufficient Cauſe, to juſtify both their Diſſent, and their Sufferings; and the better the Cauſe of their Sufferings appears to be, the more to blame will they be ever thought, by whom they ſuffer. 3. The ambitions and factious Politician will ſerve and advance his private Deſign; by ſiding with either of the diſcontented Parties; and the Vices of the Politician ſhall be laid on the Head of Sacred Religion. 4. Others will ſacrifice the Peaceable and Innocent, with their Freedom and Eſtates, to their own Avarice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Luſts, under a pretence of executing Laws, and ſerving the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good and Tranquillity. In few words, Who can reckon the many Impieties of ſeveral ſorts, that break in upon the Kingdom of Chriſt at this great Breach? The greateſt and Sum of all is, a Breach in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, in the Offices of Love. The miſchievous Effects of Diviſions, are ſo many Arguments for Union.</p>
            <p>And that which doth prejudice ſober Minds againſt the preſent Courſe of <hi>Informers,</hi> and armed Men, is, That it tends to the extinction of Love, and to enlarge the Diviſion. And for Union ſake, I deſire the following Conſiderations may have the force of Arguments.</p>
            <p>But before I come to propoſe them, I deſire it may be noted,
<list>
                  <item>1. It is, and muſt be acknowledged, that the King is Supreme Governor over all Perſons and Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, and it belongs to his Office, to protect and promote the true Chriſtian Religion, and preſerve it from what is contrary and deſtructive to it.</item>
                  <item>2. As the Offices and Duties of the Supreme Power, ſeated in the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and Biſhops and Paſtors, have been always diſtinguiſhed by our moſt approved Writers; as may be ſeen in Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> of <hi>Subjection; Bridges,</hi> of the <hi>Supremacy; Andrews, Tortura Torti, &amp;c.</hi> Dr. <hi>Nowel</hi> againſt <hi>Dorman,</hi> (which Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> brought to <hi>Hart,</hi> in the beginning of their Conference, who ſaid, That if we gave to Princes no more than Dr. <hi>Nowel</hi> did, he did agree with it); and King <hi>James</hi> himſelf.</item>
                  <item>3. When the Magiſtrate exerciſeth his Power by executing of Laws, it is the Duty of the Paſtors of the Church to uſe the Key of Doctrine; that ſpiritual Means may be applied to the Souls of Men, according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of our Saviour.</item>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102446:6"/>
4. Diſtinguiſh between Laws in their Intention, and the Application of them, which hath often fallen into ſuch hands, as turn them away from their Intention, and do not obſerve them as a Rule to themſelves in their Proceedings.</item>
                  <item>5. No Apology is made, or to be made for any ſeditions Practice or Doctrines, for violation of Peace, Subjection, and Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>We may diſtinguiſh between <hi>peccata ſpiritualia &amp; ſecularia,</hi> between <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Sins, and <hi>ſecular. His duplicibus peccatis puniendis, &amp;c.</hi> In puniſhing theſe two Sins, God hath ordained a twofold Sword or Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: a ſpiritual Sword for ſpiritual Sins, which is the Word of God; and for ſecular and outward Sins, a ſecular Sword, namely <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s. <hi>Joan. Brentius, de Jure Magiſtratûs in Anabaptiſtas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, we may diſtinguiſh between both kinds of Sins, and Evangelical Duties. The Diſſenters are not proſecuted for Infidelity, Hereſy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or for ſeditious Doctrines or for ſecular Crimes and Offences: but for meeting in ſuch Numbers for Religious Exerciſes and Ordinances; and for this, only becauſe in a manner different from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is, without the Liturgy, as hath been ſaid, and ſhould be kept in mind. And the Proſecution begins by <hi>Informers,</hi> (uſually falſe and wicked Perſons, that make a Trade of it) and ends in Fines, Impriſonments, and corporal Sufferings. The manner of doing their Work or Office, is with prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Impiety, with what Wrath and Terror they can poſſibly caſt a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unarmed People into. The Informers ruſh in with Bellowing and Roaring, with Oaths and Impiouſneſs: Sometimes the Souldier comes in with his Piſtol cock'd, and threatens he'll piſtol any one that ſtirs, he'll crack the Preacher's Crown, or piſtol him.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things inſerted, to ſeveral Uſes, and for ſeveral Reaſons which might be given, I do preſent you with the Confiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Can an Evangelical Union of Chriſtians and Churches be ever hoped for by Anti-Evangelical Means and Inſtruments? Aggravate their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Exerciſes in a manner different from the Liturgy, as proceeding from Minds tainted with no leſs than Hereſy, and to be a direct and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Schiſm, and tending to corrupt and not to edify the Souls of Men: What Means and Inſtruments more proper and effectual to attain a bleſſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102446:7"/>Unity, and to preſerve a Chriſtian Church, than what are appointed by our Lord and Saviour? Certainly he took care to preſerve the Purity of Faith, Doctrine, Worſhip, and Unity of the Faithful; or elſe he did but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what he blames, in a Man that begins to build what he cannot finiſh, ſets up a Kingdom in Satan's Kingdom, a Church in the Dominions of the World, which would run into Confuſion and Ruine from within it ſelf, except he took a courſe to preſerve it. To call and convert, and not to keep, but to loſe, had not been to act anſwerably to the glorious Name of a Saviour. Since his Manifeſtation in the exerciſe of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Office, he fulfilled all Offices in his own Perſon, as Prophet, Prieſt, and King: After his Aſcenſion, he taught and directed his Church by his Spirit, in his Apoſtles and Miniſters; and ſince their Deceaſe, by his Holy Spirit, and revealed Will and Laws. The Chriſtian Church had all Power within it ſelf, before the Converſion of Emperors, and Civil Potentates; and ſince they became Nurſing-Fathers and Nurſing-Mothers, the Church hath loſt nothing of her ſpiritual Power by it; for the Magiſtrate's Power is not privative, but accumulative. If Penalties, Mulcts, Fines, Impriſonments, and forcible Coertion, had been ſo neceſſary, it had been neceſſary to convert and ſet up Chriſtian Emperors and Kings, armed with a Civil Power, as ſoon as he had given Succeſs to his Miniſters, in calling a Church out of the World: Yet this is not to be wreſted to this very Conſtruction, as if the Church could do as well without a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, as with him. It only pretends to ſhew us, that our Lord Jeſus hath left us Means and Directions, ſufficient for the preſervation of his Church in Purity and Unity; and that thoſe Preſcriptions are moſt likely to produce his Ends.</p>
            <p>Three things are pernicious to the Chriſtian Church: (1.) Corruption of Doctrine and Hereſy. (2.) Diſunion and Schiſms. (3.) Scandal in our Lives and Manners. Our Saviour hath taken care to keep his Church from, or to reform and purge it of all manner of pernicious Acts and Works of Satan and the Fleſh: And it lay upon him ſo to do, more than upon the moſt Chriſtian Magiſtrate or Paſtor, becauſe he redeem'd his Flock with his own Blood, and took upon him to be the Head of it, and all the Honour he receives from the World, is from his Church in it; and therefore it concerns him ſo to govern his Church, that he may be honoured in it and by it. To this end the Lord promiſed to ſend his Spirit, who is the Spirit of Revelation and Truth, who leads Chriſt's Diſciples into all neceſſary and ſaving Truth, and the Spirit of Union with Chriſt our Head, and with one another, as Fellow-Members. We are inſtructed in the ſame Doctrine, governed by the ſame Laws of Worſhip and Converſation, and entitled to the ſame Promiſes, and Hope of Eternal Life; we are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſame Service, engaged in the ſame Intereſt, and are made

We are to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſet Dividers in joint; but where we do find the weak, and doubting Brother, yea more, they who cried, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I of</hi> Cephas, to be as a Heathen or Publican, or to be put away, or with ſuch an one, no not to eat? The Offences of weak Chriſtians, or ſuch as are taken at different Forms, or indifferent Things, are none of thoſe Offences that bring Wo to the World.</item>

                  <item>5. Certainly it is a Jeſs Error, to err in a Form of Worſhip, than in the Subſtance of true Faith and Worſhip. But ſuppoſe our Brethren were Apoſtates from the Faith, it were greater Mercy to force them to the Faith than to a Form of Worſhip: but Compulſion with Penalties is no where preſcribed in the Laws of Chriſt, not even to the Faith, without which there's no Salvation. <hi>Chriſto novae Legis auctori oninino hoc placuiſſe, ut ad Legem ſuam recipiendam nemo hujus vitae poenis aut earum metu pertrahere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

            <p n="2">II. It is unnatural, contrary to natural Light and Law, to puniſh Men for Religion, and not for Evil-doing. Chriſtians that believe and profeſs the whole Chriſtian Faith, that worſhip God according to the general Rules of the Goſpel, and follow Righteouſneſs and Peace, are put out of their places, when thruſt into the rank of Evil-doers. When the Apoſtle ſaith to the Chriſtian under a Heathen Magiſtrate, <hi>Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have Praiſe of the ſame,</hi> Rom, 13.3. he ſpeaks of well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing in the Judgment of Nature, and according to its Light, that well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be rewarded with Praiſe, and only evil-doing to be avenged; and that ſuch evil-doing as was contrary to the Law of Nature. <hi>He is the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil;</hi> that doth Evil in the ſight of God, forbidding the Evil in ſome of his Laws. Do our Brethren worſhip a falſe God, or the true by Images? Do they ſet up another Goſpel? then let them be accurſed. Do they diſſeminate Seditions, or act againſt Peace and Righteouſneſs between Man and Man? let them ſuffer as other Men do. And if the Priſons cannot hold them, build more for them. But they are not accuſed of ſuch Offences; they are driven from their Worſhip in their Meetings, to bring them to other Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; from one Form to another; but yet the Crime is for Religious Exerciſe, and the worſt that can be feared, is ſome Changes in Religion, or State. I cannot tell how far <hi>Grotius</hi> will be allowed to ſpeak, becauſe he was a great Party in a Faction himſelf, neither do I uſe his Name but for his Reaſon: <q>They who puniſh Teachers and Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>Haud dubiè faciunt contra ipſam Rationem</hi>—. Neither are their Pretences to be admitted, who ſay new Changes are to be feared, eſpecially Aſſemblies—. But new Opinions are not to be feared, which lead only to all things that are honeſt, and Obedience to Superiours, <hi>Nec ſuſpecti debent coetus probrorum Hominum,</hi> neither ought the Aſſemblies of honeſt Men be feared;<note place="margin">

And in the 50 §. of the ſame Chapter, he ſaith, they do very wickedly who puniſh them, who believe the Law of Chriſt to be true, but doubt or err in ſome Points, <hi>quae extra Legem ſunt,</hi> that are not written in the Law (of Chriſt) or that are ambiguous, or not expounded by the Ancients in the ſame Senſe.</q> The <hi>Jews</hi> who had the Law for them, did never impoſe Puniſhments upon the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who err'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102446:9"/>in the great Point of the Reſurrection. To prove that to puniſh Religion is preternatural, let it be conſidered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As Nature dictates, and conſents that God is to be worſhipped; and Religion is honoured, where God is honoured and owned: ſo Nature tells us, that Men muſt worſhip God according to the light and freedom of their Minds and Wills.<note place="margin">Legat. pro Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anis prope initium. <hi>Teriul.</hi> Apol. <hi>c. 24.</hi>
               </note> Upon this Principle <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thannagoras</hi> pleaded the Chriſtian Cauſe with the Emperors, that they permitted ſeveral Nations and People to worſhip their ſeveral Gods, leſt Impiety ſhould abound by ſuppreſſing the Deity, and for this Reaſon, becauſe it was neceſſary, that every Man ſhould wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that God which he had choſen. It was from the loſs of Light and Truth, that more Gods than one were worſhipped; but it was from right Reaſon, that every Man ſhould worſhip according to his own Mind and Choice. The Mercy of God is great in making himſelf known to us by Revelation, that he might rectify our Minds, and propound himſelf to us, as infinitely worthy our Choice and Service. Chriſtian Religion contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts no Dictate of Nature; it is the moſt that is asked, that our Brethren may be allowed to worſhip the true God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt with the freedom of their Conſciences, differing from us only in a few external Modes.<note place="margin">Ad Scapulm. <hi>c. 2.</hi>

               </note> next unto the Knowledg of him who is to be ſerved, that he may be pleaſed with his Worſhip. The Soul of the Worſhipper finds no Profit by, nor takes Pleaſure nor Comfort in what he ſcruples, nor doth God take Pleaſure in that Service which is not done in Faith and Sincerity. <hi>Inutilis enim Deo eſt, qui Devotione, ac Fide caret, nihil enim eſt tam volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, quam Religio; in quâ ſi animus ſacrificantis averſus eſt, jam ſublata, jam nulla eſt.</hi> Lactanct. de Juſtitia. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is contrary to good Nature to render Evil for Good, and not Good for Good. Publicans and Sinners will love and do good to thoſe that do good to them: Religion teaches all its Profeſſors to do Good to all and is attended with the greateſt Bleſſings to Mankind. The deſign of the Chriſtian Religion is to make Men bleſſed; and where it works and obtains, it turns the Heart to God, and all manner of Good, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth all that receive it to do good to all. It pronounceth a Bleſſing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102446:10"/>only upon the holy and righteous; the Preachers of it teach no other way to Bleſſedneſs but by Purity of Heart, Mercy, Righteouſneſs, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making; it ſets before us for our imitation our Heavenly Father, and our Holy Saviour, and holy Men; it enjoyns us to mind whatever things are juſt, true, pure, honeſt, lovely, and of good Report.</p>
            <p>Preachers of the Goſpel that endeavour to reſtore ſpiritual Light and Life, and to convert loſt Souls from the Error of their Ways, deſerve better Preferments than Forfeitures and Penalties, and greater Immunities than from Priſons and Confinements. And Chriſtians ſhould know, that a Willingneſs to ſave them, and Fervency in praying for them, and living ſo as to promote the Welfare of a Nation, is doing the greateſt Good to them, and deſerves a ſuitable return.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such is the goodneſs of Religion, that as ſoon as Men became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, they ceaſed to perſecute it, and did embrace it. He that hath the viſive faculty, doth receive the Light; he that hath a ſpark of right Reaſon, and Inclination to good, finds his Soul kindled with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to it, and reſolution to have and retain it. The Ignorance of the Chriſtian Religion among the <hi>Romans,</hi> was the cauſe of their Perſecution of it, and they did ill to condemn what they knew not. But all who before time hated it, becauſe they knew not what kind of thing it was which they had hated, <hi>ſimul ut deſinunt ignorare, ceſſent &amp; odiſſe,</hi> as ſoon as they ceaſs to be ignorant of it, they ceaſe to hate it. <hi>Tertull. Apol.</hi> c. 1. They who are moſt, and beſt acquainted with Religion, its Power and Nature, the Imperfection of Light, Power and Tenderneſs of Conſcience; that read the Works, and are acquainted with the Perſons of our Brethren, are moſt compaſſionate and moderate, altho there are others which will not know, becauſe they have hated them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is contrary to Reaſon and good Nature, to afflict and puniſh the Religious, becauſe they who were the worſt of Men, in whom Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature bore greateſt Rule, and in whom Honeſty and goodneſs of Nature and Conſcience was dethioned, have been its greateſt Enemies, even from <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> to <hi>Severus, Charles</hi> the <hi>ixth,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and from the High-Prieſts to <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner:</hi> Or, if thoſe Princes were vertuous and merciful in their own Natures, thoſe that did provoke, and abuſe their Power, were more degenerate Monſters than Men. Men of good Nature, will be pitiful even to them that err, or do ill throng Error If I knew that a Man did but pray for me, I would believe he loved me; and if I believed he loved me, I would not afflict that Man, but love him, and do him good; much leſs would I contend and moleſt him for the want of a Formality. The Scourges of the Ancient Chriſtians, are painted out by <hi>Lactantius</hi> as more inhumane than the moſt cruel Thieves,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102446:10"/>moſt angry Enemies, moſt fierce <hi>Barbarians,</hi> l. 5. <hi>de Juſtitir,</hi> c. 19. and that contaminated and wretched Spirits, who know and hate the Truth, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate themſelves into the Minds, and ſtir up ignorant Men to Fury, <hi>c.</hi> 21.</p>
            <p n="5">5. On the contrary; the more humane any Men have been, the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily inclined to Juſtice and Clemency to Chriſtians, tho of a different, and an unallowed Religion. Where natural Light and Conſcience is in any conſiderable Authority, there it goes beſt with the peaceable and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of a different way; it being contrary to the judgment and ſenſe of humane Nature to deal ill with them, that do no ill. Famous is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Trajan</hi> to this purpoſe: <hi>Pliny</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor for his Direction how to deal with Chriſtians, gave him this juſt and true account of them, that he found nothing in them, but obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate refuſing to ſacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> forbidding Man-ſlaughter, Adultery, Fraud, Treachery, and other Wickedneſſes. To which <hi>Trajan,</hi> from a good rectified Nature, ſent Anſwer, and gave this Order: <hi>Hoc genus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirendos non eſſe,</hi> i. e. You muſt connive at ſuch: Let not Informers, or Accuſers inquire, or ſearch for them. Upon which merciful Decree or Edict,<note place="margin">Conment. de Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianerum Perſecutione, <hi>p. 82.</hi>
               </note> the learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, in this <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor had better thoughts of Chriſtians, than thoſe Chriſtians have who have thought, that not Mahometans only, but Chriſtians ſuſpected of Hereſie, ſhould be brought into the <hi>Inquiſition; Mitior in Chriſtianos Trajanus, quàm ejuſmodi Chriſtiani.</hi> And truly, as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy is ſome degrees beyond Nonconformity, a Worm more pernicious to Chriſtianity, than it; ſo Chriſtianity was more contrary to the Emperor's Religion, than Nonconformity to ours. From the ſame Juſtice and Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and Law of Nature, <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperor gave order to <hi>Granianus</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Aſia</hi> (to whom it ſeemed unjuſt to deſtroy the Chriſtians for no Crime, and being unhear'd, to ſatify the Clamors of the People) That they ſhould be puniſhed, if they committed any thing againſt the Laws: which as the ſame great Man <hi>G. V.</hi> expounds, is meant, not if they did any thing againſt the Laws of the twelve Tables, which forbid the bringing in of any new Gods;<note place="margin">Ibid. p. <hi>89.</hi>
               </note> but, <hi>non eſſe animadvertendum in Chriſtianos, niſi ſint facinoroſi;</hi> the Chriſtians might not be puniſhed, except they were great Offenders, or guilty of Sedition. And for a Concluſion of this Head, take the Obſervation of <hi>Grotius,</hi> that God did not puniſh all that were convict of Idolatry (what more contrary and diſhonourable to God than that?) nor appointed the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to Deſtruction, till they had added other great Sins and Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities to that; <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. vid. <hi>de Jure Belli,</hi> l. 2. c. xx. §. 47.</p>

6. It is contrary to the ſenſe of the ſober and temperate ſort of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, yea it's contrary to that little that is left of Conſcience, Judgment and Modeſty in the more corrupt, and declared Enemies of Religion and Vertue, to inflict Sufferings upon the Religious, for Religion ſake, or for Exerciſes of Piety and Religion. This may be demonſtrated by three Obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it hath been the buſineſs of the moſt vile and wicked of Men to perſecute Religion; it was too cruel and baſe a Work for any other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Perſecutors of Religion have been conſtrained by a Fiction of <hi>Calumny,</hi> to oppreſs he Religious, as impious, and the holy Servants of Chriſt, a prophane, and ſeditious, dangerous Porſons; or elſe they could not draw out their Anger and Enmity againſt them, nor exerciſe it with any Authority and Approbation: this is true from our Saviour's Sufferings, as an Enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and a Deſtroyer of the Temple, throughout the days of the Apoſtles, and all Ages to this very time. Jews, Heathens, and Papiſts have feigned, and imagined Cauſes of the unjuſt Sufferings of the Saints of God. The Hiſtory of the New-Teſtement ſhews this; the Writings of the Fathers in their Apologies ſhew it, who clear the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from the ſhameleſs Slanders of Inceſt, eating Infants, and Atheiſm, and the ſouleſt of Sins. And the bloody Papiſts have invented Covers for their Cruelties: Firſt, they brand us for Hereticks, and then they burn us; and to put a Grace upon this foul Work, who are fitteſt to make and blow the Fire, and mark out the Branches in Chriſt for it, than the Friers, the Religious Orders, who profeſs a Perfection of Religion. And as if the Laws of Princes were too ſoft and gentle, theſe <hi>Clementiae Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri,</hi> Maſters or Teachers of Clemency, (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> calls them) are fiery to a third degree, above the hotteſt of them. I wiſh I could ſtop here, but I cannot, except wilfully heedleſs, but obſerve, how ſome in this Age do temper their Spirits in the very Fire, whet their Tongues, and draw Proteſtants, holy Men, and peaceable, in a colour deeper than they do Pope or Cardinals.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This will appear by the Relentings, Relaxation of the Severities, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and throwing off the guilt of Perſecutions from themſelves upon others, and pretending Fears of ſome great Mutations of State, and ſome other ways and arts of Perſecutors: it is a Work which few or none are willing to own. <hi>Domitian,</hi> a very Limb of <hi>Nero, Portio Neronis,</hi> began a Perſecution, but as much as was in him of a Man, did repreſs that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, recalling them that were baniſhed. But of all the Princes that came after, even to this very day, that favored any thing of God, or Humanity, ſhew us any of them that was an Oppreſſor of the Chriſtians; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102446:11"/>we will produce a Protector. If the Letters of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> the moſt grave Emperor, be ſearched, wherein he teſtifies, that by the Prayers of the Chriſtian Souldiers, Rain was ſent to quench the Thirſt of his Army going againſt the <hi>Germans:</hi> as he openly took off the Puniſhment from ſuch kind of Men, ſo he diſperſt it openly another way, condemning their Accuſers in worſe Condemnation. Saith <hi>Tertullian, Apolog.</hi> c.5. <q>We can (ſaith he to <hi>Scapula,</hi> c. 3.) ſet before thee the latter ends of ſome Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents that in the end of their Life have remembred that they ſinned by vexing the Chriſtians.</q> 
               <hi>Cinc. Severus</hi> (one of the Cruel Preſidents) himſelf taught the Chriſtians how they might anſwer that they might be diſcharged, <hi>c.</hi> 4. Nearer our own Times, we find that <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth diſowned the treacherous, barbarous Murder of the Admiral, and the bloody Maſſacre, and throws it upon the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> in one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and in others wrote, that it was to prevent a Conſpiracy of the Admiral and the <hi>Hugenots.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Printed after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of <hi>Ch.</hi> the <hi>ix,</hi> by <hi>P. Ramus.</hi>
               </note> And in the bloody Days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> it appears the Perſecution was contrary to the ſenſe and temper of the Nation; and who of the chief would avow it? The Queen declared, ſhe would force no Man in thoſe points of Religion: <hi>Gardiner</hi> and other Biſhops, and Privy-Counſellours openly in Court purged themſelves of it, and laid it on the Queen; ſo now it could fall no where but on the King —. <hi>Philip</hi> ſeeing all caſt upon him, and underſtanding it would make him unacceptable to the Nation, he was concerned to clear himſelf of the Imputation; therefore <hi>Alphonſus</hi> a <hi>Franciſcan,</hi> his Confeſſor, in a Sermon before him preached largely againſt the taking away of People's Lives for Religion,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornation, <hi>B. 2. p. 305.</hi>
               </note> and in plain terms inveighed againſt the Biſhops for doing it. And to conclude, even now, if this were the Vote of the Nation of Conforming Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, What's the reaſon that ſo few directly and profeſſedly engage in it, that are Men of Wiſdom, Intereſt, and Eſtates? What's the reaſon that ſo few of the poor and indigent irreligious do not turn Informers, as long as there is Mony to be got by it, as they hope? It is a ſign of a general Diſallowance and the Diſſent of common Reaſon and Conſcience. And if ever a ſearch ſhould be made into them that turn the Wheel upon Diſſenters, few or none would ſtand to it, and ſay, it as I. It is no other than a ſpuriors Act, which none will own as a voluntary delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Act; it hath a Father, but who will father it? <hi>Nolunt enim ſuum eſſe, quia malum agnoſcunt.</hi>

But now the Officer called <hi>Informer,</hi> is the firſt Mover and Inſtrument in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; an Employment that is, which many that are too bad cannot be hired unto: A ſort of Men theſe are, that are more perfect than the <hi>Proſecutors</hi> in <hi>Tertullian's</hi> Time: <hi>Tales ſemper nobis Inſecutores injuſti, impii tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, quos &amp; ipſi damnare conſueſtis, &amp; à quibus damnatos reslituere ſoliti eſtis.</hi> I'le Engliſh the Character, left ſome other make it worſe than it is: It is no more but this; They are unjuſt, ungodly, filthy, ſuch as ye are wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, (and our Judges have often condemned) and to reſtore ſuch s are condemned by them. I ſhould not dare to write this, but that I would move our profeſſed Friends to take another Courſe, more for the Honour of the Church, and our Holy Profeſſion, than this. The Church that now is can no more turn the Stream, or change the Courſe of the Law, than other Men can, and are not able to help them, (as the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>pag.</hi> 121.) But is it not fit our Governors ſhould know how it reflects upon them?</p>
            <p n="1">1. The World is poſſeſs'd with a Conceit, that this Work of undoing Men is pleaſing to ſome that do not only look on, but ſet Men on; not diſpleaſing to others, tho ſome ſay they are ſorry for it; as the ſame fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ſenſible and moving Biſhop of <hi>Cork.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſuch poor and inſufficient Miniſters are placed in many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which rather drive Men away, than give them tolerable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to attend their Miniſtry, or Hopes of Improvement. Methinks the Thing it ſelf ſhould be more offenſive than the Mention of it, when there is ſuch notorious Truth in it. The Biſhops cannot hinder their Inſtitution, but ſome are ſenſible of the great eaſineſs of ſome in their Admiſſion into Orders. If awakened Souls keep at home, there is danger that ſleepy Preaching may caſt them into a Lethargy; if they go abroad, they are in danger of the Laws.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When other Means are not uſed, or do not overcome Diſſenters, to ſet their Creatures upon them, doth alienate the Minds of Multitudes: We are not (ſay they) provided for, nor muſt we provide for our ſelves; Good Conforming Preachers dare not encourage us to go to them; and if we are received with better Welcome there, they are ſuſpected to be as bad or worſe than the Nonconformiſts.</p>

And that they ſhould be hunted and worried, and the Fleece torn from their Backs, by ſuch a ſort of Animals, of ignorant, infidel, voracious Enemies to all Religion, is a very great Affliction to the Sufferers, and Peproach upon our Religion; as if ſpiritual Means were not uſed, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Weapons had no Power; as if Chriſtians were to be tamed by irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Methods; as if the Shepherd's Voice, nor his Rod and Staff could do no Good, but the ſcattered Sheep were given up to the Dogs, to bring them to the Fold, that prey for themſelves: As if a ſelf-created Officer, that's below a Commiſſion, and unworthy of a Livery, had greater Virtue in him to cure Church-Diviſions, than Ordained Miniſters. I aſſure the Reader, this is written not to make him merry; And I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be pardoned to me, to conclude this Head with this, That 'tis no wonder the Succeſs is no better, when no more ſanctified Means and Inſtruments are employed to act in a Work of this Nature and Conſequence.</p>

               <hi>Conſid.</hi> VI. By this way the holy Ordinances of God, many choice Men for excellent Paſtoral Gifts, Qualifications and Parts, and real Holineſs, are brought to contempt, to great contempt; and this way is a very great Obſtruction to the Encreaſe of Saving-Knowledg and true Religion in many. The malignant Influences of our Diviſions upon Religion, is demonſtrated by the affectionate Biſhop of <hi>Cork,</hi> in his ſecond Sermon. I ſhall limit my Obſervation to the ſame Deſign of Peace and Unity, and keep to the Thing in hand; That this proceeding againſt the Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts, is of ill conſequence to Religion in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.<note n="*" place="margin">

But without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement, or making any offenſive Compariſons between their Miniſters, and their Hearers, and ours, there is no Man that can take the meaſure of Abilities proportioned to the Work of Chriſt, but muſt acknowledg them to come as near to the Standard, as moſt Men in the Age: And for their Auditors, generally they are Men of as much Aptneſs, Receptivity, of Apprehenſion, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Experience in the Work and Way of Salvation, as any Men of their ſeveral Ranks and Qualities, in the Places where they live, and are as great Examples of Truth, Sobriety, practical
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102446:13"/>Holineſs; and are as much exerciſed in reading, praying, conſerring, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Time, walking not as Fools, but as wiſe, as any Men that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt among us, and every way as uſeful Subjects. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Degrees of them; ſome have their Indiſeretions, and their Miſtakes, and their Heats, and their Blemiſhes; and what Party have not? But if the Grace of God hath appeared to any Men; and if any are taught to <hi>deny <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteonſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> as I am ſure there are, there are ſuch among them. And it is no diſparagement to them, that they are ſcrupulous, conſidering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Ignorance: for if Men have a due ſenſe of Sin, and have known what it is to be humbled and penitent, they muſt needs be fearful and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and then what with want of Helps, Studies, and Leiſure to ſtudy Things leſs neceſſary, many of them may not be ſo judicious, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the Knot of Scruples; and judging of Things according to their Uſe and Benefit to them, they may not be ſo taken with what others practiſe. But there are among them plain Men, of as clear Perceptions as any I ever met with, of their Education. But now both their Teachers and themſelves are under the ſcorn and contempt of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies with many, what Unacquaintance, Pride, and Uncharitableneſs can caſt upon them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is injurious to Religion, as if they that preach, pray, ſearch the Scriptures, prove giddy, unſettled, odd, and erroneous; an irrational Sect of Men, ſprung up among Men of no ſolidity or ſettlement. Hence what an Advantage doth the malignant Spirit take, to make ſo many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and carnal Fanaticks? meer Babes in Religion, that have nothing in them but what is put into their Mouths, or infecteth them with undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and ſenſleſs Popery, in this Point, That the Peoples having and reading of the Scriptures, is dangerous, as diſpoſing to Hereſy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It renders the Labours of the worthieſt of them ſuſpected and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and this is anhindrance to our Union: for who values thoſe Men that are not fit to preach? or whoſe Labours teach People to run into Fancies and Deluſions? The moſt uſeful, profitable, ſearching Books, which the World hath moſt need of, are not as much as looked into by many, but rejected, becauſe they are the Books of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> as they are called. Yea, more, if a Conformiſt have the Name of a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> ſome of our Church-Parrots will not come nigh the Door-Poſts of Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a Temptation, and I fear a prevailing one, that there is no Worſhip either neceſſary or acceptable unto God, or ſafe for the Soul, but the Legal in all its parts and accidents. Hence it is manifeſt, that all the Religion of many, ſtays at Church, no Sign or Mark of it brought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102446:14"/>home to their Houſes, and private Converſation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not maniſeſt, that many are ſo prejudiced againſt them, as dangerous Perſons, becauſe they ſuffer, that they running into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of Oppoſition, continue in a clear way of Irreligion and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; ſo far from praying, and any thing that looks like Godly, that they live in the Confeſſion of all Ungodlineſs, and worldly Luſts, and live intemperately, unrighteouſly, and ungodly, in ſwearing, ſelf-damning, and blaſpheming.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Others ſeeing that Men, that ſeem to take the greateſt care of their eternal Intereſt, are thus branded, purſued, and troubled, lie faſt aſleep in carnal Security, or take up in outward Formality. If God awaken them, they lie down again; and they are eaſily perſuaded to lie down, who are not throughly reſolved, when they obſerve this Way is every where ſpoken againſt. If a Man become truly penitent, of looſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrict, of careleſs become circumſpect, of lukewarm become zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, he is ſtrait a Fanatick, or that way enclined: And who knows not the Power of ſuch Suggeſtions and Temptations? Which prevails ſo far upon abundance of Men, ſo openly and ſhamefully, to be aſhamed of the Ways of Chriſt, and of ſpeaking of his Commandments, except it be in Cavil or Contention, contrary to the holy Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will ſpeak of thy Teſtimonies before Kings, and will not be aſhamed.</hi> Pſal. 119.46.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It makes the Wicked rejoice, when they ſee them who condemn them, as <hi>Noah</hi> did the Old World, by being moved with fear, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring an Ark, to ſee them perſecuted; and makes vile prophane Sinners run into an Exceſs of Inſolence, when they have them at their mercy, or in their hands.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is a Temptation to many, to do many things in an hypocritical compliance with ungodly Men, which in their Hearts they cannot allow, becauſe at other Times and Places they expreſs a diſlike of them, for fear of ſtaining themſelves with the diſgrace of being Favourers of Diſſenters: I mean this in one particular of Exceſs of Drinking, thoſe plauſible Arts and Introductions to it; and of joining in Diſcourſes, or not ſilencing them, which ſavor rankly loathſom of Prophaneneſs and Atheiſm.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It diſableth good Men from doing thoſe Works of Piety and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which otherwiſe they would do. It is not unobſerved, how bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful the ſober Diſſenters are in all Collections, upon publick and unſuſpected Occaſions, beſides many other Charges they are at, of contributing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their Teachers, relieving particular Perſons in great Wants, living hoſpitably. They are much weakned by Fines, Indictments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are great Loſers by the Seizure of Goods above value, and underſelling them, that they cannot do the Good they would: And who are enriched
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102446:14"/>by it, but they who will never be rich, nor bleſs'd, till they repent and reſtore? It is no pleaſing Conſideration to any Man of any Indifferency, to ſee honeſt Mens Goods carried away, to maintain ſome in open Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It is a great Temptation to as many as love this World, to follow Chriſt no more openly than <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> for they are for a Religion that is ſafe and ſaving, if not gainful. Yea, it is a dangerous thing for a Man, a private Man, a Man and his own Houſe, to ſing Pſalms, read, pray, catechiſe, when an Informer, hearing but a Voice, goes and informs of a Conventicle, and his Oath muſt be taken for the King, when really 'tis for himſelf, and his Maſter. There is ſufficient Proof and Teſtimony of ſuch Things as theſe,<note place="margin">See the Narrative out of <hi>Devon. 1671.</hi>
               </note> that ſome have been highly damnified for praying in their own Families.</p>
            <p n="10">10. It is a great Temptation to the Children of Godly Parents, to walk in Ways contrary to God and their Parents, and to beget grudgings againſt their Parents, when they are like to be Sufferers by their Parents Practices.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It is a great Temptation to Apoſtacy, I do not mean from a Faction or Party, but from the undoubted Offices and Duties of true Godlineſs. How many have, within theſe few Years paſt, fallen from the ſtrictneſs of keeping the Lord's Day, of preaching twice, of hearing carefully, of taking Notes, repeating Sermons, and Family-Duties? Yea, that have turned to a contrary way of Debauchery and Impiety, as wanting ſtrength of Grace and Courage, to own their Baptiſmal Vow, the Practice of the truly Pious, and their Saviour's Laws?</p>
            <p n="12">12. By this the Communion of Saints is much broken, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of it loſt. This Miſchief is grown now to that degree, that it is crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to hear any of them preach, or join with them in Duties in the ſame Family, be the Occaſion never ſo great and excuſable. Are they Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? and ſhall not one Chriſtian converſe with another Chriſtian, as a Chriſtian, in Chriſtian Offices? If they come to us, it is almoſt as bad as our going to them. And this Nonconformity deprives us in a great part of the practical Article of our Creed; for the Communion of Saints doth conſiſt in Practice and Exerciſe. And had we not better ſpare the Things we contend for, than an Article of Faith? Or why may not a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt hold occaſional Communion with the Nonconformiſts, in indiſputable Duties, retaining the Liberty and Reputation of his Conformity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpicion? Is it becauſe we muſt not offend Authority? Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a greater Weight is hung upon Conformity, than it can bear, if ever it be weighed in an even Ballance. We are forward to blame the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102446:15"/>more rigid ſort of Separatiſts, for not coming to our Worſhip; and why are we ſo rigid as to forbear all Chriſtian Communion with them, as if Chriſtianity were all loſt among them? O that we were as averſe from other Company, as we are from them, in holy Duties! I do declare, for this very reaſon taken from my Creed, that I do hold mental Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with all the holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling, and am prepared for local and external Communion with them in all Chriſtian Duties and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſid.</hi> VII. To ſilence, moleſt and puniſh ſound and able Miniſters, and Proteſtant Chriſtians, is as much as to render them altogether unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Church and Kingdom in a time of need, and in places that need all their Labours, and to cut them off, except they be moved by force of Law to come in, and do as we do. But the Church of God in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> hath great need of more ſuch Men as they are; and ſome places had ſat in Darkneſs had it not been for them. This is true, and therefore this courſe of proceeding with them, is detrimental to Religion it ſelf, and to the Salvation of precious Souls. Surely, either we do not know what it is to ſave Souls, or we muſt be ſenſible, that it is a Work of great Study, Induſtry and Watchfulneſs; and how a ſmall Pariſh is too great and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, without great Diligence for moſt of us; and how long it is, before we come to a holy dexterity in the management of our Calling. Who is ſufficient ſo to preach, as to be a ſavour of Life? But who is ſufficient for publick and private Work? Some make no more of it, but to ſend a Man, and a woodden Staff: but the Prophet himſelf muſt ſtretch himſelf, and breath upon the dead Child, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is matter of Praiſe to read diligently the Prayers, and preach conſtantly, but we know, that many muſt be ſetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, not by citing them firſt to Court, that way is much about, ſo far about that ſome are loſt that way and never come in; we muſt go and ſetch them in by our perſonal Applications, and Addreſſes to their Conſciences. It is better have too many than too few, ſaith the Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cork;</hi> We have too few, if they were all admitted and encouraged. And what an unreaſonable loſs is it to be deprived of their Labours, who are devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Work, and have as edifying a Gift of popular perſuaſive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation as any Men? Who have been our Teachers and Examples in this kind more than they? What an Example was the moſt faithful and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> whoſe Practice was copied after his <hi>Gildas Salvianus,</hi> and the Miniſters of that Aſſociation? How diligent was Mr. <hi>Stubbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waddeſworth,</hi> and others? But they were not worthy!

Have not they Souls? Perhaps they would be careful of them, if they were told and convinced of their Caſe and Danger; but O how well do they take themſelves to be! and think themſelves excuſed from ſaving Ordinances, becauſe they live ſo far from their Churches! The Learned Dr. <hi>Bright</hi> ſaith, ſomewhere in his Book of Prayer, that upon computation, there is a Prieſt for every fifty Perſons in <hi>France.</hi> But alas! here in <hi>England</hi> there is not a Miniſter wholly for two or three Pariſhes, in many Counties; and this where I live, I have known a poor ſilly Curat travel on foot four or five Miles to read Prayers, in ſome very populous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, where Eſquires and Gentlemen live very thick. While we are careleſs of Souls, we teach poor Souls to be careleſs of their Salvation. If the Cry of ſpiritual Murther, Damnation, of Fire, of Hunger and Thirſt, had any Entrance into our Hearts, we ſhould mind Realities more than Formalities, and not perſecute Preachers for Preaching, but ſend them forth in Peace, and commend them to God. But Preachers, yet not Preachers, make an Outcry againſt their Preaching; and others, that never knew the Need or Benefit of it, cannot endure them in their Coaſts: But they who are more concerned for the Salvation of Souls, and Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the Work of Chriſt, ſhould be otherwiſe affected. — But to uſe them as they are uſed, is not tenderly to conſult the eternal Salvation and Good of many People; and ſuppoſe them as diſaffected to the Church, whoſe Happineſs they intenſely wiſh, and would certainly part with more, if they had it, to come in again into the publick Service, than ever it coſt them to forſake it, both againſt their Wills, and againſt their Intereſt, Eaſe, Quietneſs, and Honour. I am conſident of what I write, tho I have not asked any of them the Queſtion, becauſe I do verily believe them to be wiſe, rational, and good Men. If ſome Places can be without them, tho I know not one, ſend them to Places which are in danger of being loſt for want of ſuch as they; and ſend them, as it is fit they ſhould be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>(How beautiful are the Feet of them that bring good Tidings!)</hi> with reſpect and honour.</p>

As many Places have great need of them, ſo the Lord hath been with them, his Work hath proſpered in their hands, even when their Diſgraces and Dangers have been a great Obſtruction. I never mean ſuch a Converſion (as ends in Deſtruction) to Conceitedneſs, Pride, Faction; but I mean that which is to Salvation, by Holineſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Peace. And for all their Hazards, Reproaches, and Diſgraces, an underſtanding and wiſe People hear them, which they would never do, if they did not receive Edification. Is there nothing but Humor and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation in them? Affectation of what? of Fines, Loſſes, Frowns, Threatnings, Diminution of Civil Privileges, as far as ſome can deprive them? If this be their Hypocriſy, verily they have their Reward.

               <hi>Conſid.</hi> IX. A ſafe and ſpeedy Union of Diffenters, as nearly united as poſſibly can be made, is moſt deſireable, that there may be a happy End put to their many Sufferings. Religion and Humanity can take no pleaſure in the deſerved Puniſhments of Men; the Murmurs and Complaints of Sufferers ſtir and move Compaſſions; and Pity holds the Hand even of Juſtice, in all Caſes in which Neceſſity is not urgent and manifeſt. The Evil of Separation hath been opened, when the Evil of their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings hath not been touched upon: They are urged with the firſt, but that is but one Side of the Evil; let us ſearch into the other Sore, to take the whole Weight and Compaſs of the Miſchief that lies upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion; and both run down from the ſame Cauſe; and he that would ſtop the Current of Evil in divided Streams, and dry up the Flood of Afflictions and Miſeries, muſt ſtop it at the Well head of the Cauſe. They are urged to enter into the Communion of the Church as by Law
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102446:16"/>eſtabliſhed, becauſe of the Miſchiefs of their Separations and it would be a ſpecial Service to move our Governors to make their Return as eaſy as may be, by opening the Scandal of their Sufferings. If their Conſent to our Injunctions were gained, the Controverſy would be at an end, and this Proſecution alſo: But that being not like to be attained this way, the Continuance of the Separation is more for the good and profit of the Church, than their Sufferings; for while they enjoy their Liberty, the Goſpel is preached, and they that are regenerate, and called, and gathered to Chriſt, are gathered to the Catholick Church, tho not united unto a particular Church, in ſome certain Bonds of external Communion. But if they were totally ſuppreſſed, and where they are moſt narrowly watched and kept in, thouſands of Souls would loſe the Benefit of their Labours, and their Hearts are like to be more eſtranged from us, and the Church will ſtill loſe the Content and Comfort of their Communion. The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and aggravated Sin and Evil of the Separation, is doubled by their Sufferings, and made more incurable by the Exaſperation. We ſee and taſte the Fruit of above twenty Years Proceedings, and better cannot be expected, but much worſe may be feared.</p>
            <p>To argue for a Releaſe from their Sufferings, becauſe they have ſuffered deeply, may ſeem weak and inconſequent; but take them in a Complex of Cauſes and Circumſtances, and I do hope the Argument may prove a Matter of Conſideration, to them that are concerned in theſe great Matters.</p>
            <p>If a Man ſhould move for a Suſpenſion of the Laws againſt Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, thus; Millions have ſuffered Impriſonment and Death, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpare them; the Argument is not only ridiculous and weak, but weak and ſinful: becauſe they are Malefactors, and the Laws of God, both natural and revealed, require it; and there would be no Safety to the Lives of Innocents, nor of Civil Rights and Poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p>But to argue, Our diſſenting Brethren have ſuffered much, therefore forbear to inflict more Puniſhments upon them, is not without ſome Strength, and convincive Evidence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The performance of Religious Exerciſes in a different Form, is no ſuch Offence and Crime, as deſerves to be puniſhed, before the Penal Laws decree the Penalties. The Difference of the Adminiſtrations, is made by the diverſe uſing or diſuſing of Things indifferent, ſome extending their Liberty further than others. To uſe Chriſtian Liberty (wiſely, and as much as may be, inoffenſively) is no puniſhable Crime, but a Duty; and if there be not a Liberty in indifferent Things, there is none at all.</p>

2. But if it were a Matter puniſhable, yet of ſuch Things as are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, before a Penal Law be made: <hi>Sed non ideo ſequitur eam (paenam) debere exigi, quia boc pendet ex connexione finium ob ques poena inſtituta eſt, cum ipſa poenâ;</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> writes, <hi>De Jure Bell. &amp; Pac. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap</hi> 4. §. 22.</p>
            <p>Now what can be the Ends of theſe Penal Conſtitutions?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Unity of Mind with our Governors in thoſe Things enjoined; that ſeems to be the Reaſon of the Aſſent and Conſent; which none can be of, but ſuch as were ſo minded before it was required, all Reaſons and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances perpenſed. But that all ſhould be of the ſame mind, is impoſſible in our State: That's an End not attainable, and they who propoſe it, propoſe only for themſelves; and them of the ſame Judgment with them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the reſt, whom the Lord hath received. It was a wiſe, and is a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Saying of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second, to <hi>Auguſtus</hi> of <hi>Saxe,</hi> when he interpoſed for <hi>Peueer,</hi> in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquitarian</hi> Controverſies and Perſecution. The Duke told him, he would have all his Miniſters agree with him, and among one another: to which the Emperor anſwered, <hi>Ego in negotiis ad fidem &amp; conſcientiam pertinentibus, nec auſim vel velim cui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam offerre neceſſitatem aliquam coactione: Scis irrito conatu, &amp;c.</hi> I know that will be loſt Labour, and that it is grievous and dangerous in it ſelf.— <hi>Id nunquam perficies, inquit Imperator, neque noſtrum eſt imperare Conſcientiis, ant ad fidem quimque vi cogere.</hi> Perclius <hi>Hiſtor.

            <p n="2">2. The Peace of the Church and State may be aim'd at. Can there be Peace in the Houſe of God, whilſt one Fellow-Servant ſmites another? Surely that is not the way to Peace. Which brings to my mind that of the Learned <hi>Hornbeck. (Oratione de Eccleſiarum inter ſe Communiene):</hi> 
               <q>If we ſhall receive or treat them otherwiſe than Brethren, whom Chriſt doth not diſdain, or think unworthy of ſo great a Name, Place, and Honour. <hi>Atque hoe Chriſtianae charitatis communionis<expan>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> eſt fundamentum,</hi> This is the Foundation alſo of all Chriſtian and Eccleſiaſtical Love and Charity, among all Chriſtian Churches and Congregations through the World. Let others deſpiſe the common Name of <hi>Breshren,</hi> I never call to mind, without a ſingular Affection of Piety, that holy and ſingle-hearted Cuſtom among the Ancients, both of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Age, when they ſaluted one another by no other Name than that of <hi>Brethren:</hi> So did the Tongue expreſs the Mind, and teſtify their Faith and Love, <hi>&amp;c. Communicatio pacis, &amp; appellatio fraternitatis,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks.</q> Faith and Love to God, and Reconciliation with his heavenly Majeſty, as a Father, a Participation of the ſame divine Nature, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Acknowledgment of the Marks and Lineaments of God's Children,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102446:17"/>a Conſent in the ſame ſubſtantial Truths, and ſpeaking the Truth in Love, and forbearing one another, are more ſure Ways to Peace, than Menaces and Force. <q>
                  <hi>At quanti dignius franes &amp; dicuntur &amp; habentur,</hi> who have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged one Father, God; who have drunk in the ſame Spirit of Holl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; who have breathed out of one Womb of the ſame Ignorance, to the ſame Light of Truth.</q> 
               <hi>Tertull. ad Gentes.</hi> But we have other kind of Marks and Names of Diſtinction; we ſeem to reject all ſpiritual Kindred with them, and extinguiſh Love, to compoſe Differences, and to make Peace. Will theſe Ways ever lead us to Peace?</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the Peace of the State, this may be thought of. Through God's great Mercy we find, that the Controverſy of <hi>Conformity</hi> and <hi>Nonconformity</hi> hath not diſſurbed the Quietneſs of the State, but as ſome have made uſe of it: And Church-Peace ſhould be moſt earneſtly followed, that the State may know the Bleſſedneſs of being incorporated with the Church in the ſame Government; and finding the Bleſſing of Religion to be ſo great, may be the more tender of its Welfare. The Diſſenters have not only obeyed Warrants, but have made their appearance without Warrants, when but called to it by ſome that had no Warrants, ſo far have they been from giving occaſion to the <hi>Militia</hi> to come armed upon them; but ſome will have it ſo. And the Diſſenters give, or are ready to give, the ſame Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Peace, that others do that enjoy it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Diſſenters complain of the Laws, but much more for their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, either beſides, or contrary to, or above the Laws; and to put an end to their Sufferings, is to put an end to the Illegalities of many of their Proſecutors. The many Appeals and Actions, or the forbearing to make Appeals when there hath been apparent Cauſe, the many Errors found out in Courts of Juſtice, where it hath been done them in the Proceedings of Informers and others, prove this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To put an End to theſe Vexations and Sufferings, is the only way to reſtrain much Impiety and Unrighteouſneſs in many Men, and to delives them from provoking &amp; tempting God to plague &amp; puniſh them that carry on this Work. The Spirit of Perſecution entred not into the Church, till Men walked after the Fleſh; and after that Perſecutors have fallen upon the Servants of God, the Wrath of God purſued the Perſecutors. Men ſhould abſtain from declaring their diſlike, diſaffection, and enmity to Godlineſs, if they loved themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Yea, moreover, I do not ſee how any of the Inſtruments in the Sufferings of our Chriſtian Brethren, can go on, and not ſin grievouſly againſt God, Men, and Themſelves. It is plain, that they neglect all the ſolemn and publick Worſhip of God, the ſtanding Means of their own Salvation, while they lie in wait to take the Worſhippors of God. And
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102446:18"/>what their Practice is in other Duties of Religion, Truth, and common Honeſty, is well known: They come behind none of their Father's Children, in Lies, Falſe Witneſſes, confirmed by impudent and notorious — Swearing.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If this Way be not pleaſing to God, try another; if it be not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Succeſs, try ſome other. It was the wiſe Counſel of <hi>Livia</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> perplexed about the Conſpiracy of <hi>Cinna,</hi> which that wiſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror took: <hi>Fac quod Medici ſolent, qui ubi uſitata remedia non procedant, tentant contraria; ſeveritate nihil profeciſti.</hi> Ser. <hi>de Clement.</hi> It is known in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the Advantages of all temporal Penalties to the Catholick Church changed St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Judgment from Lenity to ſome Severity; but never changed it from a ſweet Moderation, to a Rigor, making no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſome and others; as appear in his ſeveral Letters of Interceſſion for the <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> And for all that, ſome are ſo ſtrict upon St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> as to note, that he but narrowly got to Heaven before <hi>Hippo</hi> was taken, for that hand which he had in that Motion. The Severity of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Monarchs, in <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> is but ill applied to our Caſe, who cannot rigorouſly, eſtabliſh our Conformity, without the Extirpation or Baniſhment of an excellent great Number of Chriſtians, that have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from, and whoſe Predeceſſors ſprung up together with the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Conſiden,</hi> Whether it be not better for the Church, and the Chriſtian Kingdom, to take off theſe Afflictors from chaſing that part of Chriſt's divided Flock, than ſuffer them to go on: For how can that be pleaſing to Chriſt, wherein the Enemy of Mankind, the Eneiny of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians above all Mankind, and the Enemy of Proteſtants more than of any Chriſtians, becauſe of their clearer Light and Purity, and the Enemy of the ſincerely Pious above all other Proteſtants, hath ſo openly appeared and acted, in Lies, Scandals, Falſe-Witneſs, Perjuries, Violence, and Unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulneſs. This is a ſurer way to loſe, than to gain them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If they are loſt, who can help it? How can they be united to us, that are not united among themſelves? They are very far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a piece. Beſides <hi>Preshyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> there are <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Millenaries, Anabaptiſts, Quakers;</hi> ſhould we yield to any one of theſe, we are yet as far from gaining the reſt, as we are now from uniting all. Thus the Reverend Peace-maker of <hi>Cork, pag.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>But this Objection of the Difficulty, is not paſt ſome conſiderable Reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What if the Bundle of Arrows be broken, yet let us gather up as many as we can; our Artillery will be the more againſt our common
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102446:18"/>Enemy, Gain any of them, and we ſhall be the more and ſtronges by that Addition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Except the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> the moſt of the other Diſſenters agree in their Modes of Government; ſo that what you grant to the Party, is granted to more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it Reaſon and Charily, that thoſe who would unite, ſhall not, becauſe all will not, upon ſome Abutements?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Gain ſome, and they will help to draw in others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The more are united, the ſewer remain to be tolerated by whith Toleration I mean no more, but a forhearing one another in Love, with the uſe of Goſpel-Means to convince and gain them, if poſſible and by the Civil Sword to reſtrain and ſuppreſs them, when it ſhall be neceſſary, and dangerous to the State, but not before.</p>
            <p>And I crave leave to make a little Digreſſion upon this Head, reſpecting the ſeveral Parties named.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Prasbyterian,</hi> to called, doth not inſiſt upon that Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; He offers to come in.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The chief of the <hi>Congregational</hi> are Men of great Worth, Learning, Sobriety, and Holineſs; and they are but few, and never like to be many, in the Countries, and but few in Cities and populous Flaees.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> is an Independent in Government, for ought I know: what will do the one good, will do the other, in that point. And theſe are either ſimply ſcrupulous in the Point of Baptiſm, or elſe compounded of other Notions. The firſt ſort are reputed peaceable and holy Men, by them that write againſt them, as Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Mr. <hi>Obed Wills,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph Whiſton.</hi> The ſecond may be kept in Order and Quiet, as eaſily as our careleſs, ignorant, and debauched Sects, that go under another Name.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Antamenian,</hi> as ſuch, is a Doctrinal Diſſenter, yet thinks in the point of Imputation, he is the Antipapiſt, and the Proteſtant, and falls in among others in point of Church-Diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Millenarian,</hi> is either notionally ſo, and then his Faith is to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> anti-magiſtratically, and ſo he is to be watched and coerced, and Presbyterians and Independents will help.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The <hi>Quaker</hi> muſt have the Right of Humanity. The Honour of all good Men Sir <hi>Matthew Halt,</hi> determined their Right in the Point of Marriage. My Soul grieves for them. Some of them, that I know, are a ſort of Chriſtians; they do not give enough to the Scriptures, which as fat as I know, is their great Error, from whence the reſt proceed. Their ſpiritual Loſs to me ſoems vaſt. They are gone far from us indeed, but I wiſh it were conſidered, that ſome Magiſtrates, in their extreme Heats and Violences, did urge them with Oaths when there was no cauſe for it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102446:19"/>and picking quarrels with their Scruples, they fell to a haſty and violent Execution of their own violent Paſſions, more than the Law. They who ſcrupled ſwearing did call God to Witneſs, and did proteſt and promiſe Loyalty and Obedience, but it was not accepted; they offered the Security of their Words, and their Bodies to the Law, when found Tranſgreſſors againſt the Peace; But they were hurried and crouded into Priſons, and ill uſed in many Priſons, and ſo became hardned, and at length modell'd into an exact Policy. Yet they are Men and Natives; and whether Men ſhall forfeit their Goods and Liberties, for a Diſſent in Religion, by any Goſpel-Rule, or Rules of Chriſtian Equity, is a great Queſtion, and the Negative paſt doubt as yet. If they have a natural Right to Marriage, and thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts ſtand, tho not made after the Liturgy, they have a natural Right to Society among us; and our Rule is, To walk honeſtly towards them, as they that are without. There are many Things commendable in them.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the noted Sects looked upon with an evil eye, as dangerous Men, and yet there are other Sects very pernicions, but what Courſe is taken with them? Are there not <hi>Hobbiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts?</hi> were there ever more of theſe ſince the Reformation than now? Witneſs the great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Sermons preached and printed, the great Numbers of Tracts, the large Volumes of Sir <hi>Matthew Hale,</hi> and others, againſt Atheiſm. Are theſe multiplied without cauſe? if not, there is a great enceaſe of Atheiſm. What ſhall be done with the Sects of Inſidels Blaſphemers, God dammens, Drunkards, Gameſters, Who amongers, and their Meeting Houſes? Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Men without Callings, Pamphleting Clubs, Paper Indendiaties, and the Society of Beggars and Vagrants, that are of no Church? What do you call thoſe Places, where many of our Nobility and Gentry either learned or were confirmed in their Levity Vanity, and are ſo tainted with a ſort of Wit and Words, that makes the Word of Chriſt and of Wiſdom, upſavoury and mean, where many have learned the Gifts of Conſidence and Immoralities? where Swords have been drawn, and Blood ſhed, but never indicted for Riots? Where have Perſons learned to put off God, and Conſcience, and Counſels, with wiety Anſwers, to excuſe their long lying in Bed, till Prayers, and Sermons, and Sacraments are over or their long dreſſing till Dinner to make their Afternoon-Viſits before to the Idols or Images like themſelves? Who can reckon all the Sects that diſſent from Chriſt's Goſpel, from their Baptiſmal Vows; that ſay they are for the Publick, tho they rarely viſit them; for the Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, with a ſecret Reſervation, except what requires them to be pure and holy? O the low Eſtate of Chriſtian. Religion, even among them that have the general Name of it. May it never fare worſe with Perſons and Places for Religious Exerciſes, than with moſt of theſe, who perhaps
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102446:19"/>never had more than a private Reproof, and they will be ſparing of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints!</p>
            <p>And now I turn in from this Digreſſion, to give a few Narratives of the Nonconformiſts Sufferings, in which it will plainly appear,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Perhaps no Law was ever executed with more Violence and Partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or Proceedings with leſs Succeſs, and more Miſtakes and Errors in Proceedings, more arbitrarily and illegally, than thoſe againſt Diſſenting Proteſtants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is no wonder they have been ſo unſucceſsful to bring them in, if you reſpect both Perſons and Methods unlike to effect that End.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How it concerns all Men, according to their Places and Power, to petition a Ceſſation of theſe Proceedings: (1.) To put an end to the groſs Wickedneſs of many Inſtruments, who take occaſion from the Laws to exerciſe their Irreligion and Wickedneſs. (2.) To prevent further Judgments upon many particular Families and Perſons, and the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Chriſt to take away his Goſpel from us, when many of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are ſo ill uſed, and his Ordinances blaſphemed, and Wickedneſs committed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The various Appearances of God, both in Judgment and Mercy, in this very Proceeding.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let it be judged and reſolved ſoberly, whether this way be not a greater Scandal to the Proteſtant Religion, than the Separation is, as great as it is.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thoſe who are glad of the Law, have no cauſe to think the very Law it ſelf of any great uſe to their Deſign, provided, (1.) They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt the Nonconformiſts ſtrictly according to the Scope of the Law: (2.) According to the Direction of it, as to Proofs and Conviction: And if Men did not go beyond it, they could never have done what they have done.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It will be manifeſt, that they are not puniſhed for Sedition, Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any Crime of that Infamy and Note by the various kinds of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and Puniſhments.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some are puniſhed in ſeveral Courts, and ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="9">9. How the Adverſaries of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> have been defeated of their Purpoſes; ſome brought to Ruine, and miſerable Ends; ſome peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and converted, and all or moſt fruſtrated of their Deſigns.</p>
            <p n="10">10. How groſly many have acted againſt all Humanity and Law, againſt God, againſt that Reverence which is due to the King, and his own Act. And many other Things will occur in the enſuing Narratives.</p>

I am not void of Senſe, as not to know what a tender Point I have in hand, and what Perſons are like to be provoked; but I do write to call them to Repentance, to move others to Compaſſion, and to give Warning to them that need it,<note place="margin">See the Rev.

            <p>By all which it will clearly appear, what kind of Men, and to what Scope they acted, that have appeared moſt active in theſe Proceedings.</p>
            <p>I begin with the famous Sufferings of Mr. <hi>Andrew Parſans,</hi> Rector of <hi>Wem</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire.</hi> In <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1660, he was fetched from his own Houſe to <hi>Salop,</hi> by ſix Souldiers, who pretended to have, but ſhewed no Warrant. The Marſhal told him, he was his Priſoner, and next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning brought him before the <hi>Deputy-Lieutenants,</hi> who asked him, If he would take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy? he told them, <hi>He had taken them long ago, and would cheerfully take them again, if they required it;</hi> and did ſo.</p>
            <p>They told him, Complaints were made againſt him, (1.) For not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming. (2.) For ſeditious Preaching. To the firſt, he pleaded the King's Declaration. 2edly, He deſired the ſecond might be explained, and Particulars proved. They charged him with ſaying, <hi>There were more Sins committed (then) in one Month, than in twenty Years before:</hi> Inferring
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102446:20"/>thence, beſides the Scandal to the King's Government, that he accounted the King's Murther no Sin, which was committed within that time. His Accuſers were then in Town, but appeared not; and he was diſcharged of his Impriſonment without Fees, and appointed to appear, when his Accuſers ſhould be ſummoned to appear face to face, and was admoniſhed to conform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eaſter</hi> following, one of his worſt Enemies, by a Faction, was made Church-warden for the Year 1661. And among other things, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Profanation of the Lord's Day, and oppoſed an ancient Lecture which of courſe returned to that Town, and procured a Letter from the <hi>Deputy Lieutenants,</hi> to a Juſtice of Peace in the Pariſh, to hinder it. The laſt Tueſday in <hi>November,</hi> hearing no Bell ring, he went to know the Reaſon: He found the Church-Doors lock'd againſt him, and that Church-warden owned it was his Act, and told him he ſhould not go in, tho he told him he would preach himſelf. But by an Accident he got in, tho with difficulty, and ſome danger; and two Lectuters preached to a great Auditory of Neighbour-Miniſters, and People. Next day he, the Preachers, and Miniſters that heard, were by the High-Conſtable ſummoned before the <hi>Deputy Lieutenants:</hi> He and one of the Preathers (Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi>) were committed to Priſon, the reſt checked and diſmiſſed. After four days Mr. <hi>Lawrence</hi> was releaſed, but Mr. <hi>Panſons</hi> was detained, upon pretence of other Matter, amounting to Sedition, if not Treaſon. He could not obtain the Sight of the Articles, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave to return home upon Security, and limited not to go above five Miles from home, and to appear when ſent for. In the mean time one of the <hi>Deputy Lieutenants</hi> told him, they could not reſt for his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Importunity, who with nine more, and ſome of them in Drink, gave in Depoſitions againſt him.</p>

               <hi>Jan.</hi> 29. The Marſhal, with five Troopers, came galloping to his Door, (where he met them) entred his Houſe, ſhewed a Warrant from Sir E. B. Commander in chief of the Forces in <hi>Salip,</hi> to bring him before him; who told him, he had an Order from the Deputy to commit him cloſe Priſoner, under the Marſhal's hand, for Things of a high Nature. During ſix Weeks Impriſonment, he uſed all means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a Copy of the Depoſitions; at the end of which ſix Weeks, the Power of the Deputies expiting by the Act for the <hi>Militia,</hi> they reſolved to leave him bound, and commit him, as Juſtices of the Peace, upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of Treaſon, to the Common-Goal.</p>

               <hi>March</hi> 3. on the ſame Day, came down a Letter from the Right-Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Lord <hi>Newport,</hi> Lord Lieutenant, from <hi>London,</hi> which one that ſigned his Commitment intercepted, and kept from him ten days and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102446:21"/>was afterwards brought him by a Friend of the Gentleman, which gave Order for his Releaſe, upon Security to return when ſent for: but he was not releaſed.</p>
            <p>After eight Weeks abode in the Common-Goal, the Lord <hi>N.</hi> brought down a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> out of the Crown-Office, with a ſpecial Order under the Seal-Manual, to the ſame Lord, and one of the Juſtices in <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and eight more Gentlemen, (whereof three only were preſent) to try the ſaid <hi>A. P.</hi> Clerk, late of <hi>Wem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 28. the Commiſſion was eexcuted, the Juſtice gave the Charge to this purpoſe: A Miniſter was to be tried, all <hi>Presbyterian Miniſters</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon, among whom Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> was particularly named. In the Afternoon the Grand-Inqueſt brought in their Bill. The Court was guarded with Souldiers; Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> was brought to the Bar, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hold up his hand; the Indictment was read, and he required to plead.</p>
            <p>Before he pleaded, he, after much earneſtneſs in deſiring, and ſeveral Denials, was allowed to ſpeak to the Court, which he did briefly, and as well as he could, being abuſed by word and deed, by a Souldier that ſtood by to daunt him. He bleſſed God, that at length he might know for what he was ſo long impriſoned; that it was a Privilege to be tried by a Peer of the Realm, whoſe Honour made up the defect of an Oath; hoped the reſt of the Gentlemen, being Perſons of great Repute and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and was confident nothing ſhould be done but according to Law and Equity: He heard well of the Jury, and preſumed, they had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Diſcretion to judg of his Proſecutors, as they ſound them free from Malice, Partiality, and a bad Life.</p>
            <p>He craved a Copy of his <hi>Indictment,</hi> and Councel. He was earneſtly commanded to plead, or they would proceed againſt him as Mute; which he did, firſt begging his Pleading might not be a Prejudice to him, as to his Exceptions againſt the <hi>Indictment;</hi> which was promiſed. After which he pleaded, <hi>Not guilty,</hi> and put himſelf upon God and his Country.</p>
            <p>He was commanded to hold up his hand a ſecond time, and another <hi>Indictment</hi> was read; which he did as before.</p>
            <p>He was commanded a third time to hold up his hand, and a third <hi>Indictment</hi> was read, which was only for <hi>Noneonformity,</hi> to which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pleaded.</p>
            <p>His learned Councel firſt moved for Copies of the <hi>Indictments.</hi> Copies of the two latter were granted; but the firſt denied; but being read to them again, they took ſuch notice of it, that they were enabled to plead to it next morning, with great ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102446:21"/>
The Matter of the Indictment was: <q>Not having the Fear of God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by the Inſtigation of the Devil, and a malicious Mind againſt the King and Government, to bring his People into hatred of his Perſon and Government, did maliciouſly preach, <hi>Octob.</hi> 13. 1661.</q>
            </p>
            <q>

                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> There was more Sin committed now in a Month, than in a Year, for twenty Years paſt.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> When there were good Judges and Kings in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the People feared the Lord; but when there were wicked Judges and Kings, then every one did what was good in his own Eyes.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>3.</hi> There was better Preaching now, than was ſince the Apoſtles Times.</item>
                  <item>

               </list>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe Words were put in the Indictment, and made to come under the Act for the Preſervation of the King's Perſon.</p>
            <p>The Words in the ſecond Indictment were: <hi>That a King, who is driven out of his Kingdom by his Subjects, and afterwards by Providence he entreth peaceably, and then ſetleth his Militia; and then having made himſelf ſtrong, beginneth to play his Pranks, and rules at his pleaſure, like a King or Tyrant: So the Devil comes to a Man's Elbow, and then gets poſſeſſion of his Heart, and then will play his Tricks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Words ſpoken by him were theſe, and in his Notes, and atteſted by four Men who wrote after him, and ready to be teſtified by twenty more ready in Court; ſpeaking of the Power and Kingdom of the Devil, which he got by degrees in wicked Mens Hearts: <hi>It is with the Devil, as with a King, who when he is ſetled in his Dominion, hath diſpoſed of his Milina, and Miniſters of State, he may do what he will; Indeed till this be done, he may do as he may: So Satan, when he hath once put out the Eyes of the Conſcience, and ſeared it, and made the Will of his Party, and charmed the Affections, he may now do what he will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It grew late, and his Proſecutors were not called till the next day; therefore he only aſſerted his Innocency, and Clearneſs of Conſcience, that he ſaid nothing to bring his Loyalty into ſuſpicion, or himſelf under the Law. But Judg <hi>T.</hi> aggravated the Words, in the moſt uncharitable Conſtruction, at large, and ſaid in his Conſcience, he meant it of the King.</p>
            <p>He pleaded, the Time limited in the Act was paſt before indicted, and other Arguments, which his Counſel did learnedly and rationally manage: But the Judg told them, the Court would over-rule. Next day he was brought to the Bar, deſired his Adverſaries might be near him, face to face; but it was not granſed, but ſtood where he could ſeldom hear them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:102446:22"/>
The Jury being called to paſs on the firſt Indictment, he moved, he might make peremptory Challenges, the Judg anſwered, No. Of Sixty eight that were ſaid to be returned, there were but three or four of them that were called; the reſt were privately ſent to: They lived remote from him and ſo he could not challenge with cauſe. The Proſecutors were nine, but moſt of them were paſſive, drawn in by the Subtilty of the Church-warden, and his Brother, who ſware directly the Words in the firſt Indictment, but miſſed the Time when he ſpake. Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> denied the Words, and his Counſel pleaded, the Words were not crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The Jury being inſtructed, were ſent forth, and preſently returned him, <hi>Guilty,</hi> and followed the Inſtructions more than the Evidence; as one of themſelves told a Friend of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> And ſo it proved, as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors had given out.</p>
            <p>Such another Jury paſt upon the ſecond Indictment, of Strangers, not a third part of them mentioned in the Return.</p>
            <p>The Church-warden and his Brother ſwore the very Words; and a third, the Subſtance, but differing from them.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>P.</hi> denied the Words, and had four ſubſtantial Witneſſes, who had taken the Words exactly from his Mouth, when he preached. Theſe, and twenty more, did aſſert the Truth in another place, who were not regarded in the Court.</p>
            <p>His Counſel pleaded, The Words were not proved, and if proved, were not within the Act.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi> did openly affert his Loyalty, by running ſeveral Hazards of Life and Eſtate, when the King paſſed with his Army to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and that he ſent a Horſe and Arms to the <hi>Cheſter</hi> Buſineſs; beſides his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Praying for him on occaſional Preaching, his Adverſaries being Judges.</p>
            <p>But, as it was foretold, the Jury brought him in, <hi>Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sentence was, for the firſt Indictment he was fined an hundred Pounds.</p>
            <p>The like for the ſecond; and to lie in Priſon till the Fines were paid.</p>
            <p>He was before his Conviction made uncapable of any Eccleſiaſtical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. After Sentence paſt, he only ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During the Trials many Incivilities paſt: A grave and reverend Miniſter of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was ſtruck by a Souldier in open Court; and other godly and reverend Miniſters of the Country were ſcornfully thruſt out of the Court; and his Friends in Town durſt not be preſent at his Trial: And Friends and Foes concluded he ſhould die, or at leaſt be undone.</p>
            <p>After his Trial, he continued near three Months in Priſon, till the Lord <hi>Newport,</hi> unknown to him, procured the King's Pardon for his Fine. His
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102446:22"/>Living was preſently ſequeſtred by the Chancellor of <hi>Litchfield.</hi> And perhaps the Greatneſs of his Parſonage made him the more obnoxious, for he told them in open Court, that his Benence was condemned long ago, and that 400 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> was bidden for it by a great Man in the County; the Loſs of which amounts by this time to between five and ſix thouſand Pounds.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman was tried with him, for ſtabbing his own Servant, of which there was clear Proof, and his Noſe felt a bleeding in open Court, but was brought io, <hi>Not guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of the Jury, when he had conſidered what was done, came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward much dejected to Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and told him, the Foreman went againſt the Sence of the Major Part: He alſo went to the Judg, and told him ſo, who replied, he need not trouble himſelf about that, with other Words.</p>
            <p>And this was the End of this great Malice and Violence of ill Men.</p>
            <p>Let us obſerve: A Miniſter of approved Loyalty, who ventured Life and Eſtate for the King's Reſtauration, at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes often impriſoned, brought, like a Traytor, to hold up his Hand, which he had often lifted up to God in Prayer for the King; the Court guarded with Troopers, and not the Sheriffs Men; his Friends and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters were not permitted to ſtand by him; the Indictments found, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt better Evidence of better Auditors, even four that wrote Sermon-Notes, againſt the common Senſe of a Jury made: And after all this (loyal) Traitor (for before the Trial, and in it, his Words were ſaid to amount to Treaſon) is only Fined, committed till it be paid, and after three Months, the Fine remitted. And this formidable Trial was on part of the high Day. <hi>May</hi> 29. in which one that had prevailed with God to ſee it, more than all his Adverſaries, had no matter of Joy leſt him upon it, but the rejoycing of his own Conſcience.</p>
            <p>This brings to my mind, how touchy and captious many Men were at Preachers and Sermons in thoſe Days, of which I could give ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in but one eminent Conforming Miniſter, who ſuffered very much by quarrelſom and injudicious Hearers.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time many eminent and good Miniſters were brought into Trouble and Priſons; and 'tis not unlikely but the Judg might mean the Presbyterians in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> of which an Account is printed and abridged by Mr. <hi>Care,</hi> 2d Part of the <hi>Hiſtory of the Popiſh Plots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it like that any thing of Accommodation, or Union of our woful Breaches, could enſue ſuch Proceedings? Is the Suſpicion groundleſs, that there was a Deſign to keep out ſuch Men as theſe? And that Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians made great uſe of theſe Mock-Plots, to give colour to their Deſigns,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102446:23"/>which afterwards they formed. And ſome thought themſelves never well in, unleſs ſome others might be ejected. Nonconformity was a Crime in Mr. <hi>P.</hi> before our Act of Uniformity came out, and whilſt the King's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration only commended the Uſe of the old Common-Prayer-Book, as far as Men could go, and declared, no Man ſhould be puniſhed for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Whitlock,</hi> Vicar of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> after the King's Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs came forth, and before the Act of Uniformity took place, was indicted at the Seſſions in <hi>Nottingham,</hi> for not reading Common-Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 2. He was cited into the Eccleſiaſtical Court; and in caſe he ſhould refuſe to read Common-Prayer in the Surplice, in that Pariſh-Church, he ſhould be ſuſpended within the Archdeaconry of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and his Church to be ſequeſtred.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Barret</hi> was ſuſpended the ſame time; and <hi>July</hi> 7. the Order of the Court paſſed for the publication of their Suſpenſion, for not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Monition of the Court. Upon the ſame day there was an Order of the Court for ſequeſtring the Profits, with this Expreſſion, <hi>Gum jam legitime vacat, &amp; Curato caret.</hi> [<hi>Note,</hi> This was before the Suſpenſion was publiſhed and denounced, and whilſt the King's Declaration promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Indemonity.]</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner was Mr. <hi>Jo. Barret</hi> indicted, ſuſpended and his Church (St. <hi>Peter's</hi> in <hi>Nottingham</hi>) ſequeſtred, and he forced to leave his Free hold in which he lived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 26, 1662. Mr. <hi>William Reynolds,</hi> Lecturer. of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s is <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> was peremptorily inhibited Preaching, and receiving any Prefits, and to appear at the Conſiſtory-Court at <hi>York, Auguſt</hi> 8. following; at which time no Articles were produced againſt him, yet he was ſuſpended, and referred to the Viſitation, <hi>Septem.</hi> 9. following, at which he appeared, and received theſe Articles: <q>(1.) No Man, by the Laws and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of this Realm, is to preach, and adminiſter the Sacraments, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Epiſcopally erdained, (2.) Notwithſtanding which, he hath ſo done in the Pariſh of <hi>St. Mary Nottingham.</hi> (3.) About <hi>July,</hi> he was inhibited Preaching in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, and in any other Place in the Dioceſs of <hi>York,</hi> (which was not in the Inhibition) and about <hi>Auguſt</hi> was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</q> (4.) Yet once or more he had preached there, (which was not true.) He reſuſed to give his Anſwer under his Hand, becauſe the Articles infringed he Act of Indemnity for which he was admoniſhed three times, immediately one after another, and then excommunicated,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102446:23"/>by Dr. <hi>Burwell</hi> Chancellor of <hi>York;</hi> and <hi>Septemb.</hi> 15. iſſued out his Order for the publication of it, <hi>propter ipſius manifeſtam contumatiam, in non exhibendo reſponſa articulis.</hi> Hearing of a purpoſe to take out the Writ <hi>De Excommun. capiend.</hi> he was neceſſitated to go to <hi>London;</hi> and upon ſuggeſtion in the Court of Common-Pleas, of the Violation of the Act of Indemnity, the Lord Chief-Juſtice <hi>Bridgman,</hi> and the other Judges, granted him an Order, <hi>Hilar.</hi> 14. In <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term following, he was conſtrained to <hi>London,</hi> and to ſtay there the whole Term, to ſee if Dr. <hi>B.</hi> would ſhow Cauſe, but he never appeared, and ſo Mr. <hi>R.</hi> heard no more of it, tho it was not taken off till the laſt Act of Indemnity. All which was a great Charge to Mr. <hi>Reynolds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well known, what Endeavours were uſed, to remove the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Learned Dr. <hi>Tuckney,</hi> from his Profeſſorſhip of Divinity, and Maſterſhip of St. <hi>John</hi>'s in <hi>Cambridg,</hi> betimes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660, before he came to the Trial of <hi>Nonconformity</hi> by Articles; which could not affect him.

[<hi>See</hi> Care<hi>'s 2d Part of the Hiſtory of the Popiſh Plot.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Before the Act of Uniformity came out, twenty of the Auditors of two ſober Miniſters, who preached at <hi>Beaſton</hi>-Church in <hi>Nottingham ſhire,</hi> were indicted for a Conventicle.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Oliver Heywood,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Coley,</hi> near <hi>Hallifax,</hi> was proſecuted in the Conſiſtory at <hi>York,</hi> for not reading Common-Prayer, a whole Year before the Act of Uniformity commenced, and whilſt his Majeſty's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration granted an Indulgence; was ſuſpended, <hi>June</hi> 29. 1662. and excommunicated, and could not by any Interceſſion be abſolved by Dr. <hi>B.</hi> unleſs he would take an Oath, <hi>parendo juri, &amp; ſtando mandatis Eccleſia.</hi> And going to hear Sermons at <hi>Hallifax,</hi> Dr. <hi>H.</hi> deſired him to forbear, being an Excommunicate; and at <hi>Coley</hi> one made an Attempt to thruſt him out of Church, for the ſame reaſon; and Twelve-pence a Sunday was demanded of him, for not coming to Church, during this Excluſion. And at length a Writ came out; but the Bayliff who was to ſerve it, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him ſo much as to ſmother it, and ſo he eſcaped the Priſon.</p>
            <p>Many that were ſtrongly inclined to Unity and Peace, and forbore to conform as far as they could, in hopes of reforming ſome Things, and leaving Things moſt ſcrupled, at leaſt indifferent, were urged by violent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102446:24"/>Perſons with Conformity, before the new Law was made; and ſtrange Informations and Reports were raiſed againſt worthy Men, and occaſion taken from their ſcrupling ſome Things, to repreſent them as unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and unfit for Union; and as if they were hatching new Miſchiefs, which their Souls abhorred, ſtricter Laws muſt be made on purpoſe, not (as it proved) for the Publick Good, but private Turns.</p>
            <p>We may not forget who were very forward in ſuppreſſing Lectures, and diſſolving thoſe Combinations which had for many Years preſerved the Truths of God freſh in the Minds of Multitudes of People, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had been loſt, or in danger; in unſetled Times, kept Miniſters to their Studies, Love, and Acquaintance among them, and were managed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, or hindrance to our National Settlement. Some of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors were Gentlemen in Power, and meer Tools in other Mens hands, and theſe liſtned to falſe Reports of Whiſperers and Tale-bearers; or elſe they were Perſons of ungodly Lives, ſuch as proſecuted Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and debauched Perſons, that ſerved their Luſts.</p>
            <p>Two ſuch were Enemies to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> at <hi>Nottingham.</hi> One preſented the Book of Common-Prayer to him, a Whoremonger, caſt out or the Town-Council, leaving his own Wife to work for her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or ſhift as ſhe could for her ſelf, he took another Man's Wife away with him a great way off, and kept her ſeveral Years. Another Perſon, who was to teſtify that the Book was tendred to him, was an Atturney, who afterwards ſtirred an Adverſary of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> to put a forged Bond of 400 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> for Non-payment of 200 <abbr>

               </abbr> in Suit againſt him. And that Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> might not have Remedy in Chancery, he was preſented in the ſpiritual Court, where it had ſoon come to an Excommunication, had he not removed out of the Dioceſs, into <hi>Litchfield</hi> Dioceſs. And that Atturney, when the Commiſſioners ſate upon the matter of the Bond, feared to come out of Doors, being then in Debt, (tho a landed Man, and likely to have flouriſhed in the World.)</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, were the forward Men to bring good Men into Trouble, and were ſooner heard than better Men, till they became diſcovered.</p>
            <p>It is clear, that Nonconformity was not the only Cauſe of our Breaches and Miſeries, but a Spirit of Diviſion from God, and Diſaffection to his Servants, and Peace with Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> of <hi>Whitweek,</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> gives this Account under his hand, among many other Troubles: There came Letters from the Duke of <hi>N. C.</hi> relating a Plot in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> to the Deputy-Lieutenants in <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> whereupon the Lord — and other Deputies, ſent the Conſtable
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102446:25"/>to fetch Mr. <hi>B.</hi> before them, and told him, they conceived it neceſſary to ſecure him, as ſuſpected of the Plot. He told them, His Lordſhip was <q>the firſt Man he heard ſpeak of the Plot, and being Treaſon, I muſt, ſaid he, and I will reveal it; I know nothing but what I have from you, and I muſt make it known.</q> His Lordſhip drew out Letters and Papers, which he ſaid were from the D. of <hi>N.</hi> and other Lords, to ſhew him; but he ſaid, he would ſee no Papers which did concern any Plot. The next day he went to the Earl of <hi>Stamford,</hi> and diſcovered what he heard from the Lord —, who diſcovered it to other Deputy-Lieutenants; and ſo Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> eſcaped that Snare.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch Informations (againſt the Ejected Party) it is like, the King and Council ſent down Letters, to demand Security of the Peace from ſuch Perſons as they ſuſpected: Upon which pretence, Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> was, with other Miniſters taken, and clapt in Priſon at <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> but they were after a Time releaſed. Among whom was Dr. <hi>Hen. Wilkinſon,</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Hall in <hi>Oxen,</hi> a Perſon of that great Openneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Heart, that no Man can believe him a Party in any ill Deſigns <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> when the reſt were releaſed, he was detained a while, upon pretence of keeping a Conventicle with his Fellow-Priſoners, to whom he preached one Lord's-Day in the Priſon.</p>
            <p>After the Act of Uniformity took place, it is impoſſible to relate the Number of their Sufferings, and great Trials, with Hardſhips upon their Perſons, Eſtates, and Families, by uncomfortable Separations, Diſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Unſettlement and Removes, Diſgraces, Reproaches, Impriſonments, chargeable Journeys, Expences in Law, tedious Sickneſſes, and uncurable Diſeaſes, ending in Death; great Diſquietments and Frights to their Wives and Families, and their doleful Effects upon them; and in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, various Appearances of Divine Providence, great Supports, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deliverances, and ſtrong Reſolutions, with a clear ſatisfaction of Conſcience, as to the Cauſe of their Sufferings, are impartially to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>How various are the degreees of Light, and the Dictates of Conſcience, even in good, wiſe, and ſelf-ſearching Men, and that even in a diviſion of Judgment and Practice! The firſt Cauſe is different degrees of Light, and means of attaining Knowledg. Some are more deep and quick, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and induſtrious, have better means and opportunities of knowing: ſome can take in a greater Latitude of Circumſtances, and can compare Circumſtances, and the Things themſelves, and judg of the Good and Evil. I do not now take notice of the Blaſſes of Education, Prejudices, Prepoſſeſſions, and Paſſions of Men, nor the Influence of the World upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102446:25"/>Mens Alterations. And the true Reaſon of Reſolution and Peace, which Men have in theſe different ways, is their Sincerity and ſtrict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of their own Light and Judgment, and the Purity of their Motives.</p>
            <p>And from hence ariſes a Neceſſity of performing ſeveral Duties; ſuch as, <hi>Let us not judg one another, but forbear one another in Love.</hi> Let us humbly acknowledg the Imperfection of our own Underſtandings. We have not all Knowledg; we know not other Mens Reaſons, Thoughts, and Hearts: We ſhould amicably confer when we meet, and hold our Candle to ſhew them the Way, when we think theirs is out; (this is to be underſtood of doubtful Things, and not clear Scripture Matters of Faith and Worſhip.) It ſhould teach us Long-ſuffering, and to mortify our Paſſions, and tie up our Tongues and Hands from Perſecution: Better my Hand be cut off, than that I ſtretch it out to ſtrike any Man that is approved of God, for ſuch Things wherein he approves himſelf unto him.</p>
            <p>Let us take our Diviſions to Heart, and think the Sufferings of our Brethren in this Life ſufficient, and too much, and ſpare to condemn them ſo Hell, as Hypocrites, and evil Workers. There are ſome Conformiſts within my knowledg, that I am confident would never have conformed, unleſs they had thought it had been their Duty; and they have Peace therein: They were not drawn in by Preferments, nor driven in by Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>There are and have been Nonconformiſts, that are as clear in their Nonconformity.</p>
            <p>I was well acquainted with one, and I never was acquainted with a more loyal, ſincere, holy Man. After many Diſgraces and ſharp Trials, eſpecially to a generous genteel Spirit, in <hi>England,</hi> he went beyond Sea, and in a terrible Storm at Sea, which broke into the Ship, he asked his own Soul, If he could die in and for that Cauſe of his Sufferings, and leaving his Native Country, to preach in a ſtrange Land? His Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence gave him a plain and full Anſwer, when ready, as he thought, to leave his Body and dear Relations in a deep Sea. After his Return, he told me this and other Paſſages, with a moſt ſincere Profeſſion, That he had nothing told in this World but to ſerve Chriſt, nor any thing to ſeek but Chriſt; with whom I believe he is, and with him will appear, as one that ſhall judg the World.</p>
            <p>Did that eminently learned and excellent Mr. <hi>Joſeph Allen,</hi> in or after his many Impriſonments, terrible Convulſions, and daily Self-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, recoil from his Reaſons for Nonconformity? He was certainly ſo clear and reſolved in this, that in his laſt Conflict with the Devil, three hours before his Death, Satan did not attempt him there: but this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102446:26"/>of him, — <hi>I care not to be longer in this (dirty) World, than either my Maſter hath doing or ſuffering-Work for me; were that done, forewel to Earth.</hi> Pag. 90. of his Life.</p>
            <p>It was thought he would conform, till he ſaw what Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was required. Another worthy Perſon, Mr. <hi>Joſeph Baker</hi> of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> did read the Service, but went out, and on his Death-Bed ſaid, He could have done any thing but ſin.</p>
            <p>Take a fourth Teſtimony, that able Scholar and Miniſter, Mr. <hi>John Thompſon,</hi> on his Death-Bed, in a Chamber over a naſty Privy, (which was conceived to annoy him, into a Fever) in the Common-Goal at <hi>Briſtol,</hi> told his Friends that were about him; <hi>As for my Bonds, I bleſs God for them; and if I had known when I came in, that I ſhould die here, I would have done no otherwiſe than I have done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many more ſuch Profeſſions of Satisfaction might be gathered, but I muſt not be tedious. Neither were theſe the confident Sayings of fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men, but rational. The firſt of theſe four debated the Caſe with one of the greateſt Biſhops in this Age; and was more ſatisfied in his Diſſent, ſince he diſcourſed the Points. And the laſt offered to diſpute the whole Caſe with the Biſhop, and others that ſtood by, with this Caution, <hi>Tolle Legem, &amp; fiat Certamen;</hi> which was moſt diſingenuouſly conſtrued by ſome of them thus, That he would have the Laws removed, and fight it over again; as it is in the Reply to the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Narrative, printed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1675.</p>
            <p>And no leſs preparation of Mind could carry them through all kinds of Afflictions and Sufferings, except Exile, and the Ax, or a more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious Death.</p>
            <p>The Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cork</hi> can hardly believe the Brethren to be ſo poor as they are ſaid to be. But can they chuſe but be poor? If you conſider their Number, their Charge, their ſmall Time of enjoying their Livings, the ſmall Number of the rich and wealthy that do own them, ſo far as to be their Patrons or Benefactors; the great Loſſes of their beſt Friends by the Fire of <hi>London,</hi> Decay of Trade; and, beſides the long Taxes that lay upon them in common with others, many of them have been great Sufferers in their own Eſtates: Some Congregations having enough to do to afford a ſmall Maintenance to their own Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and having many occaſions to exhauſt them, to help them out of Priſons, to maintain them in Priſons, and many other ways conſtant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Charge. Beſides theſe Conſiderations, a few Arguments are convincing. I read in the Life of that Gentlewoman, of a great Mind and Contrivance, Mrs. <hi>Baxter,</hi> what his preſent Circumſtances were, and what reduced him into them. How frugal and parſimonious that wiſe and good Man, Mr. <hi>Jo. Corbet,</hi> was, that he might have to communicate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102446:26"/>to them that were in want! And the good Sums of Money which that great Example and Truſtee of Charity, Mr. <hi>Tho. Gouge,</hi> hath given out of his own Purſe, to ſome good Men in exigence; beſides ſome private Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, which have been made for ſome good Men, of deſerved Note. Twenty or forty Pound is a good Collection; but alas! how little a way will it go! how ſoon ſpent in a Family! and ſuch Collections muſt not come often about. The Reverend Mr. <hi>B.</hi> tells us, his Wife engaged to procure a Man of Note 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> but it fell ſo ſhort, that ſhe, to make good her charitable Undertaking, paid 12 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> out of her own Purſe. Theſe are next to Demonſtrations. And I doubt not, but Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> can name the Men, that live upon little more than brown Bread and Water. I have heard of ſome in <hi>Cumberland,</hi> that have but eight or ten Pounds <hi>per an.</hi> to keep a Family; ſo that a piece of Fleſh hath not come to one of their Tables in ſix Weeks time; their Allowance could ſcarce afford them Bread and Cheeſe. One of them went to Plow ſix days, and preached the Lord's Day: And Mr. <hi>O. W.</hi> in the Weſt Country, was forced to cut Tobacco for his Livelihood. Thoſe Juſtices of Peace, that have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years been zealous in that part of their Office, know the Poverty of the Preachers, by their iſſuing out Warrants upon ſome of the Hearers, becauſe of the Poverty of the Preachers. Out of reſpect to the Worth and Modeſty of ſome of them, I forbear their Names.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two worthy Brethren, and Fellow-Labourers, Mr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whitlock,</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1662. removed out of the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage-Houſe, where they and their Families lived together, as they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done, and went to <hi>Colwick-Hall,</hi> which proved very unhealthful to moſt in both their Families; were (<hi>Septemb.</hi> 1663.) both ſeized at their Meeting, and brought to <hi>Nottingham</hi> by Souldiers, and with others indicted at the Aſſizes, where they came off, paying a ſmall Fine. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 20. 1665. at ſeven of the Clock in the Morning, being Lord's Day, one of the Deputy-Lieutenants ſent three Souldiers to ſeize them, who brought them to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> where, by an Order, (nothing being ſaid to them) they were ſent to the Marſhal's, where they were detained Priſoners, no Charge given againſt them, nor ever called to appear, till <hi>Octob.</hi> 13. following, at which time they were by the D. Lieutenants ſet at Liberty, giving Bond to appear at ſix days warning, at any time before next Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes; but they never heard more of them.</p>
            <p>It was thought that Impriſonment (on the Five-Mile Act) was the Cauſe of a fifteen Weeks Sickneſs to Mr. <hi>Reynolds:</hi> Before he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of it, they were conſtrained to remove their Dwellings, <hi>March</hi> 25. 1666. and for three months were conſtrained to live from their
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102446:27"/>Families, before they could meet with a convenient Dwelling, which was fifteen or ſixteen Miles diſtant from <hi>Nottingham.</hi> They preached in the Night, and early in the Morning, out of publick Time, and yet were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted twice for Conventicles, were often diſturbed; and once Mr. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds</hi> was ſeized, the Officers breaking open the Door by force, who brought him before the Mayor, and would have indicted him upon the Five-Mile Act: But he was diſmiſſed, making it to appear, he was upon his Journey to <hi>Cambridg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Joſeph Truman,</hi> (well known by ſeveral well-ſtudied Treatiſes in Divinity) was often indicted, and once ſued to an Outlawry, which was very chargeable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A brief Narrative of the Sufferings and Impriſonment of</hi> Mr. Francis Bampfield, <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Sherburn <hi>in</hi> Dorſetſhire.</p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Sherburn,</hi> by long and earneſt Sollicitations, obtained Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> to ſucceed that loyal and reverend, very pious Divine, Mr. <hi>Will. Leyford,</hi> moved thereunto by the experience and knowledg of his Loyalty, (in a conſtant aſſerting the Royal Cauſe in all Changes, and ſuffering for it) as of his eminent Abilities. Being utterly unſatisfied in his Conſcience with the Conditions of Conformity, he took his leave of his ſorrowful and weeping Congregation, the Lord's Day before St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> 1662. In a ſhort time after he removed to another Houſe in Town <hi>Septemb.</hi> 19. following. As he was, after his wonted manner, before he came to <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn,</hi> in Family-Duty, and Exerciſe upon 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.6, 7. (whence he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That way which the Devil and his Inſtruments hinder Grace, God will wiſely over-rule to further it,) and divers of his Neighbours with him, intent upon the Duty, one <hi>S.</hi> with other Souldiers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him in the King's Name to be ſilent, and with the reſt to depart the Room. This <hi>S.</hi> was neither of a ſober nor baſhful Temper, but ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ſuch a Service, yet could not utter his Command without much conſternation, ſpeaking a Word in a Breath.</p>
            <p>Before this, two Deputy-Lieutenants had been conſulted, to know if ſuch an Exeroiſe as Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> uſed were contrary to Law, but without any Anſwer from them, one <hi>T.</hi> an Apothecary, came with <hi>S.</hi> and ſaid, he had a Warrant from the Deputy-Lieutenants, to ſerve upon Mr. <hi>Bamfield,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> his Aſſiſtant, (a very worthy Preacher) and ten more of the chiefeſt of his Auditors then preſent, and thereupon took theſe two worthy Miniſters, and above twenty five more, to Priſon, in the Houſe of the Provoſt Marſhal, where they all continued Priſoners till Wedneſday Night following, ſeparating the Preachers from the People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:102446:27"/>
In this Priſon, about twenty two of this Company, whereof one was very old, had but one Room to them all, and but one Bed in it, for five Days and Nights. But the Priſoners turned their Priſon Chamber into a Chappel, and ſpent their Time like an holy Prieſthood, in praying, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating Sermons, and ſinging Pſalms. Saturday, about ſeven or eight of the Clock, Leave being obtained, the Priſoners came together, (I ſuppoſe by that time they had more Rooms allowed them) and while one of them was in Prayer, the Souldiers brake into the Room, and ſpake aloud, calling him <hi>Rogue,</hi> and bidding him make an end; laid hands upon him, and forced the reſt of the Priſoners away.</p>
            <p>On the Lord's Day, after one denial, Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> had leave to preach to the Priſoners. Many of the Town deſired to be preſent, and ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave of the Souldiers, (paying a Fee of Entrance) to go in, but were thruſt out again after they had paid their Money. Some got into a Backſide, and heard, and were threatned with Writs for the Treſpaſs, by the Owner of it, whoſe Wife gave them leave; and Satisfaction of ten times the value was offered him for the Treſpaſs.</p>
            <p>One Evening the Souldiers would needs ſhew ſome Devotion, and when he that read the Service, came to <hi>Lighten our Darkneſs,</hi> one of them, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it had been a Pſalm ſet up a Tune to ſing: So unskilful were theſe Men in the Form of their own Devotion, being better at hindring others, than performing themſelves the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>The Lord's Day at Night, the Miniſters and Priſoners had leave to come together, and Mr. <hi>Philips</hi> to preach; but whilſt he was in Prayer before Sermon, the Souldiers came violently in, and took away his Chair, and diſturbed the Exerciſe; and ſo they had no Sermon.</p>
            <p>Upon Wedneſday following four or five of the Deputy-Lieutenants met, and called Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> before them firſt, then Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reſt of the Priſoners. Sir <hi>J. S.</hi> of <hi>Par.</hi> was in the Chair, (who could come into Conteſt with Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> in point of Loyalty, in trying Times, it ſeems.) Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> owned he was worſhipping God in his Family, his Doors open, and that divers of his Neighbours came in, Many were the Miſchiefs imputed to their hearing and withdrawing, tho not one thing was charged to be in the Prayer or Preaching, tending to Sedition, or otherwiſe peccant; however, cauſe or no cauſe, the Chairman declared the Exerciſe did tend to Sedition, and required Sureties for the Good-Behaviour, and Appearance at the next Aſſizes, which he did: And the ſame was required, and given by Mr. <hi>Philips,</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:102446:28"/>
While they were in Priſon, divers that brought Proviſions for their Friends, were not permitted: Some who came to viſit their Friends in Priſon, were impriſoned with them: Some had the Proviſions taken from them, and the Souldiers made merry with it. Some were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain to carry Meat in their Hat-Crowns, that it might not be ſeen. Some were violently handled, and kicked down Stairs.</p>
            <p>Some of the Priſoners had been Souldiers for the King in the Wars. A Thouſand Pounds Security was offered for one of them, who had been a Souldier for the King, that he might go home to his Wife, who lay in at his Houſe, a little way from the Marſhal's Houſe. The Siſter of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (a Souldier for the King in the Wars) was violently uſed; and the Victuals carried for her Brother, was taken from her.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners paid double Fees, to the Juſtices Clerks for Recognizances, and to the Provoſt-Marſhal, the ſame Gentlemen being both Deputy-Lieutenants and Juſtices: They paid for the Souldiers Attendance to guard them; that is, to diſturb them, and abuſe their Friends, as you heard before.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Joſhua Kirby,</hi> Preacher of the Lecture at <hi>Wakefield,</hi> founded by the Lady <hi>Cambden,</hi> (90 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per an.</hi>) ſetled there by the Company of Mercers, <hi>London,</hi> was ejected, 1662. but continued preaching in his own Houſe, on the Lecture-Day, till a Lecturer was ſetled in publick. After the Lecture was ſupplied, he was wont to preach in his own Houſe on the Lord's Day Evening, after his hearing in the Pariſh-Church, except when he was hindred, to avoid Warrants, and Writs, <hi>De Excommun. cap.</hi> or Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the latter end of 1665, he was forced by the Five-Mile Act to leave his Houſe and Family, and travel abroad, to his great Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Trouble, and of his Family, till he took a Licenſe from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to preach, 1672.</p>
            <p>He was once committed for Neglect, Contempts, rebellious and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diſobedience to the Laws, (in preaching in his own Houſe, which is not contrary to that Act of Uniformity, upon which they proceeded with him,) for three Months, <hi>Novemb.</hi> 21. 1662, by five Juſtices of the Peace. But to avoid this, he travelled abroad, till the <hi>Mittimus</hi> was out of date. <hi>Feb.</hi> 20. following, 1662, another <hi>Mittimus</hi> is made, to carry him to the Common-Goal at <hi>York,</hi> during three Months. He was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſent accordingly, and remained a cloſe Priſoner, never going out of the ſaid Goal, paying 10 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> a Week for Chamber and Diet, as the Goaler teſtified.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:102446:28"/>
               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 26. 1664, after the Conventicle-Act came out, being the Lord's Day, as he was coming from Church, he was taken by the Bayliff of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> and was not permitted to go to Church in the Afternoon; and after two or three Nights ſtay at his Houſe, was again ſent to the Goal in <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle, for three Months.</p>
            <p>After his coming home from <hi>York,</hi> other Warrants were prepared for him, in which are theſe Words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Whereas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> divers Sectaries, and diſloyal Perſons, as we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, to the Terror of the King's Liege People, do notoriouſly, <hi>impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,</hi> and ſeditiouſly meet in the Houſe of the ſaid <hi>J. K.</hi> a Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Nonconformiſt, under colour and pretence of Religious Exerciſe, in other manner than is <hi>allowed</hi> by the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> — The ſaid <hi>J. K.</hi> doth traduce and revile the King, and the Church, — diſturb the Peace, and turmoil the Nation in new Combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Confuſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> —</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Joſ. Kirby</hi> did conſtantly frequent the Church, whilſt he was permitted, preached with leaſt Offence, and avoided all appearance of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and, in the Time of the Uſurpation, was a conſtant and loyal Affertor of the Royal Intereſt, inſomuch that he ſuffered for his Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therein: But Preaching in other manner than is allowed by the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Practice, (what are thoſe kinds of Religious Exerciſe, that are <hi>diſallowed</hi> by the Liturgy?) is a Crime, that hath Blackneſs enough in it to deface his Loyalty.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, he was ſent by another <hi>Mittimus</hi> to Goal to <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle; but they who made it, were ſo exact and careful as to miſ-date it, and to make the Time of going in, to be the Time of his coming out; and the Goaler obſerving it, refuſed to receive him, and ſo he eſcaped that time. But the Conſtable that went with him, with that wiſe <hi>Mittimus,</hi> was ſo civil and courteous to him, that he deſired him, that he would be pleaſed to take his Lodging there, till he ſhould go back to <hi>Wakefield</hi> for another <hi>Mittimus.</hi> What an officious Officer was this, to be willing to take the pains to fetch another <hi>Mittimus,</hi> asking nothing of Mr. <hi>Kirby,</hi> but to bear his Charges! I am much taken with the Kindneſs of this honeſt Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that would ſave Mr. <hi>Kirby</hi> a Journey himſelf, to fetch a better <hi>Mitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>

            <p>To ſend Miniſters to the Common-Goal, is not much to their Honour; but to ſend any to the Houſe of Correction, is to ſend them whither Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are ſeldom ſent, I think.

            <p>Here was indeed a Warrant (ſuch as it was.) But another Miniſter, (whoſe Name I conceal, to avoid Offence, and for Shame) was at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, by oral Command of a L. put in the Town-Stocks, in his own Pariſh, to the great Grief and Trouble of his People, (whoſe Miniſter he had been thirteen Years, elected by them, and preſented by the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Patron to his Living) where he continued for the ſpace of two Hours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1669. Mr. <hi>O. Heywood,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Coley,</hi> near <hi>Hallifax,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to preach near <hi>Leeds,</hi> on thoſe Words, <hi>Walk worthy of God.</hi> But the Mayor of <hi>Leeds,</hi> (whoſe Name I will not publiſh, becauſe he repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Raſhneſs and Incivility) hearing of it, ſent Officers to diſturb the Meeting, who did it effectually, with rudeneſs, who brought him to the Mayor, who treated him like a Fury, holding up his hand as tho he would ſtrike him, and ſpeaking Language unfit from a Magiſtrate to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and threatning to proſecute him to the uttermoſt, ſaying, <hi>Have not you been once in our Hands already?</hi> No, Sir, (ſaid Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) I never was in Priſon, but once for the King, in Sir <hi>George Booth</hi>'s Riſing. <hi>The more ſhame for you now,</hi> quoth Mr. Mayor, <hi>cannot you reade, Fear God, and honour the King?</hi> In ſhort, he was carried away with Lanthorns to the Common-Goal, called <hi>Capon-Hall,</hi> and there put into a Room like a Swine-Sty, having nothing in it but Heaps of Straw. But the Goaler was ſo civil, as to have his Lodging cleanſed, and freſh Straw brought for him, and to ſuffer a Bed to be brought in for him by his Friends; and leaving him ſome Conveniences, but diſarming him of his Knife, he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102446:29"/>courteouſly left him to his Reſt, which was diſturbed by Dogs and Cats fighting in the Room below him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Next day Mr. Mayor ſent for him, would have had him given Bond for the Behaviour, and fell into another perplexity, diſtracted between his own Spirit, and the Spirit of them that made him their Inſtrument, ſaying, What ſhall I do? I am put in this place; I would do for the beſt, and would willingly diſmiſs Mr. <hi>H.</hi> but I fear I ſhall be called into queſtion for it, and brought into danger for it. But ſome wiſe Men and Friends promiſed to interpoſe between him and Danger, and ſo he became exceeding courteous to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> freely diſmiſſed him, telling him, it was pity the Church ſhould loſe his Gifts, and other kind Diſcourſe. — But he and thirty ſix were fined at the next Seſſions, and himſelf put into the Eccleſiaſtical Court for the ſame Fault.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>R. Smith,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>VVh. S.</hi> in <hi>Somerſet,</hi> to which he had a legal Title, was forced out by the Violence and Power of a Popiſh Family, in <hi>April,</hi> 1662, (before the Act of Uniformity came out: Thence he removed to <hi>Dynnington,</hi> where he had ſome Eſtate of his own: whence he was conſtrained, for Peace and Quietneſs, to remove to <hi>Chard,</hi> to be out of the way of one who had informed, that he had been inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the People to Rebellion, when in truth he was two days abroad, as a Phyſician to divers Families, and the Forger of the Information let it fall. When the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act came out, in his Circumſtances he could remove no whither but to his Eſtate at <hi>Dynnington,</hi> where he had not been many Months, but his former Enemy, and ſome Confederates, wrought him great Troubles, of which one was a Proſecution in the Eccleſiaſtical Court at <hi>VVells.</hi> He was a fourth time conſtrained to remove, and not only to leave, but to ſell his Eſtate, and to avoid Troubles, to remove into the remote Parts of <hi>Devon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> Rector of <hi>D. B.</hi> in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> after <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. was put upon a new Way to maintain his Wife, and five ſmall Children; and upon the Advice of Friends, he was encouraged to ſettle in a Corporation near to him, where by his Pen, and help of Relations, he had a comfortable Livelihood, until the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, which forced him to remove, and to rent a Farm in <hi>Derby-ſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chantry,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>VVeeford</hi> in the ſame County, was neceſſitated, by the ſame Act of Corporations, to remove with his Wife and four Children into another Country, to take a Farm upon a Rack-Rent. His Family in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, he could not afford to keep either Man or Maid, but was forced
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102446:30"/>to labour hard, and fare hard, and with Labour and Thrift could not pay his Rent, but ran in Debt, to his great Trouble and Affliction, yet lives upon it ſtill, having eight Children.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> an aged Miniſter, of <hi>North-Taunton</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> was carried before one Juſtice <hi>G.</hi> (without any reſpect to Age or Epiſcopal Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> was threatned to be ſent to the Work-Houſe, where (ſaid the Juſtice) you ſhall hear better Preaching; and further, <hi>You,</hi> May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard, <hi>who made you a Preacher?</hi> He replied, he was of old, Epiſcopally ordained: To whom the Juſtice anſweren, <hi>I hear you teach Children to ſuck in Rebellion; you ought to be baniſhed the Realm, and if you return, to he cut aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſame Juſtice is ſuſpected to be Popiſh, by his Words at <hi>Cholmleigh,</hi> at a Privy-Seſſions, declaring, <hi>The Nonconformiſts deſerved to be executed, as well, if not better, than the Traiterous Jeſuits that were executed at</hi> Tyourn.</p>
            <p>Two Miniſters licenſed by the King, were informed againſt for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Licenſed Places, and were brought before the Juſtice at the Bell in <hi>Cholmleigh,</hi> who adjourned to the Church-Yard, where he charged them with the Breach of the Statute of 22 of <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The Miniſters pleaded, there was no Proof, that the Religious Exerciſes were in other manner than according to the Liturgy: It is no matter, ſaid he, for the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the aſſembling of more than the Family. They pleaded their Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Secretary of State. After about two hours pleading in the open Air, to the hazard of their Healths, (bare-headed, 'tis ſuppoſed) he fined the Preachers 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> apiece, the Houſe 40 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> for two Meetings; and ſaid to one of the Preachers, pleading the King's Declaration, <hi>What do you tell me of a whimſical Declaration?</hi> And the other Preacher ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him his Licenſe, he refuſed to look upon it, and ſaid, <hi>It may be an old Almanack for any thing I know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Root,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Sowerby,</hi> near <hi>Hallifax,</hi> was forcibly taken out of his own Houſe, 1663, by virtue of a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> upon a <hi>Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit</hi> by three Bayliffs, who broke the inner Door of a Room where he was, hurrying him faſter than his Old Age could bear, not ſuffering him to take as much as a Coat, nor a Staff nor Money in his Purſe, nor to receive the Salutations of his Daughter in-Law, who ran into the way to meet him, nor to ride upon a Horſe, which another Reverend Miniſter that rode, and overtook him on foot, lent him to ride upon, without leading the Horſe by the Bridle; So he alighted, and went on foot to <hi>Hallifax,</hi> and thence to <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle, Priſoner for three Months. After a time, he was again ſent Priſoner to the ſame Place for ſix Months; but the Juſtices under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102446:30"/>that the Commitment was contrary to Law, he was at three Months end diſcharged. Yet a third time he was ſent to <hi>York</hi> Caſtle, by Sir <hi>J. A.</hi> ſhewing no Cauſe, till further Order, where he continued Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, cloſe ſhut up in a little Room, and not ſo much as his Wife per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come to him, no, not ſo near him as into the Caſtle, to know if he were ſick or well, alive or dead, till his Son by ſome means procured Liberty for his Mother to ſee his Father, but was not permitted to take part of his Lodging with him: And at length a Favour was procured for him, to be removed out of the Caſtle into the City. Between both Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he continued near a whole Year. Heres a long Impriſonment; but you ſhall hear of more Troubles upon his Son.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Timothy Root,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Sowerby-Bridg</hi> Chappel, in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> for preaching after <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. 1662, till he was ſatisfied to conform, or the Congregation provided for, was by Sir <hi>J. A.</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſent to <hi>York</hi>-Caſtle, (his Wife lying in of her firſt Child) for three Months. In 1666, he was ſent to Goal again, for no matter of Fact, till further Order. At which time the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> came to <hi>York,</hi> and it was ſaid, he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him, and many others; but he did not. Shortly after the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> came to <hi>York,</hi> and finding no matter of Fact againſt any of them, diſcharged them, upon Bond for the Good-Behaviour.</p>
            <p>When the Five-Mile Act came forth, Mr. <hi>Root</hi> was forced to leave his Habitation and Family, and Farm which he had taken, to his great Loſs, and his Wife ready to lie in, and to abide at his Father-in-Law's, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo his Wife and Family came, when ſhe could go abroad, and there continued, till going to <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to viſit ſome Relations, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by a Doctor, who diſturb'd him as he was preaching in a Chappel, upon the deſire of his Friends: But the Doctor miſtook his Name, and ſo he eſcaped. And the Perſons indicted with him did traverſe the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and coming before Judg <hi>Littleton</hi> at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> the Judg worthily declared, <hi>If we made publick Places, where the Bell was tolled, to be riotous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, they would preſently cauſe all People to turn Papiſts.</hi> Some rive Months after Mr. <hi>R.</hi> was invited to preach at the ſame Chappel, being vacant, for which he was indicted again for a Riot, which proved chargeable to him. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1670. he was deſired by ſome Friends at <hi>Leeds,</hi> to preach at <hi>Shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> Chappel one Lord's Day, the Place being deſtitute. Whilſt the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was ſinging a Pſalm, came the Lord <hi>S.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> Mr. <hi>C. &amp;c.</hi> and twenty four Troopers, with ſome Bayliffs; he was drawn out of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, into the Chappel-Yard, where he was afraid of his Life, becauſe of the trampling of their Horſes, (and now alſo his Wife lay in of a fourth Child.) He cried to them to keep off their Horſes; he was in their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102446:31"/>hands, and they in God's: <hi>In God's hands,</hi> ſaid the Lord, <hi>no, thou art in the Devil's hands.</hi> His Pockets were ſearched, and a Reccit was found, which had his Name in it; which he confeſſing, they make a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> to carry him to <hi>York</hi> Goal, where he was kept up cloſe Priſoner in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whither the Under-Goaler came, and told him, Except he would give them 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> he ſhould be loaden with double Irons, and caſt into the Low Goal, among the Thieves. He put them off as well as he could without Money; but after fourteen Days Confinement to his Chamber, he was brought forth, and double Irons were laid upon him, heavier than any of the Thieves, whoſe Co-priſoner he was like to be. The Goaler locked the inner Door in the Day-time, and would not permit him the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Thieves, to walk in the Caſtle-Yard, to take the Air; nor a Bed-ſtead to be ſet up, but he laid a Bed, which he got, upon Straw. On the Lord's Day following he would have preached to the Thieves, and other Priſoners, ſtanding only at the Holes where the Priſoners begged: But whilſt he was at Prayer, the Under-Goaler came with a Command from the Head-Goaler, for him to deſiſt. But when he had thus lain about four or five Days and Nights, two Juſtices in the Weſt, Capt. <hi>B.</hi> and Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſent a Certificite for him to Mr. <hi>C.</hi> upon which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed, yet not without being bound to appear at the next Aſſizes at <hi>York;</hi> where waiting all the Time of the Aſſizes, and nothing coming in againſt him, he was finally diſcharged from that Trouble, which was very char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable to his Purſe, hazardous to his Wife, vexatious to his Friends, and ignominious in a high degree. He was four times indicted in ſeveral Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and put to very great Charges of Journeys, Traverſes, <hi>Certiorari's,</hi> Fees, and Removes: He was thrice thrown into the Common-Goal at <hi>York,</hi> and once laid in double Irons, cloſe ſhut up; not favoured to lie like a Man upon a borrowed Bed; not permitted on a Lord's Day to preach to the Priſoners: And all this for preaching, neither Sedition nor Hereſy, upon Invitation, and where there was great need.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Nathan Heywood,</hi> of <hi>Ormskirk</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> was wont to go frequently to hear the Service on the Week-Days; and for all that, a ſtrict Command was ſent to him, (by Warrant ſent to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden) and to two Gentlewomen, both Proteſtants, and to them alone, to come to Church-Service, or elſe they ſhould be proceeded againſt upon the Acts of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and K. <hi>James.</hi> He pleaded, that he had the King's Licence to preach at Chappels. The Juſtice not ſatisfied with this, ſent out his Warrants for Twelve-pence a Sunday, altho he ſaw Mr. <hi>Heywood</hi> preſent at Common-Prayer, upon occaſion of a Funeral. The next day after he recalled his Warrants, turning it into Jeſt, as if he intended only
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:102446:31"/>the Quakers, but blotted out the Names of two notable Papiſts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 4. 1673, the Juſtice himſelf intended to break up the Aſſembly at <hi>Scarsbrick</hi> Chappel, but was diſcovered, being croſſed and hindred in his coming, by notable Providences, and being diſcovered, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſorbore Preaching. When the Juſtice came, finding himſelf diſappointed, he was in a great Rage, and drove the People out of the Chappel Yard and Chappel, and bad them depart; and in his way home again, he called upon a Conſtable (a Papiſt) charging him to go to the Chappel, and keep poſſeſſion of it till four of the Clock; which the Conſtable did, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king other Papiſts to his Help, who all made merry in the Chappel, and ſmoaked Tobacco, and kept out Proteſtants from the Worſhip of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. The Juſtice, in a Letter to a great Lady, whoſe Chappel it was, declared, That he intended to have been there himſelf, hearing the Liturgy would be read there; but being indiſpoſed, he could not come, deſiring her to do her ſelf the Honour to break up the Meeting which was to be there: But ſhe thought it a greater Honour to encourage Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to preach, and the People to hear. His Servant ſtaid Sermon, as well as Service, and told his Maſter what was done, according to his Command; and ſaid, to his diſpleaſure, he never heard a better Sermon, and deſired him to ſend him thither as often as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>A Lawyer, and a Parliament-Man, adviſed the Lady to have the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy read in her Chappel, and the Juſtice could not touch them: Which was done, and for all that he ſent out Warrants to levy the Fine upon the Hearers, and ſent ſeveral times Officers to take Names; and <hi>March</hi> 8. ſent a Threatning to Mr. <hi>Heywood,</hi> he would come and pull him out of the Pulpit by the Ears; and ſent a Warrant to diſtrain Forty Pounds upon his Goods, for a ſecond Offence. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was appoineed to meet the Juſtice at <hi>Leverpool,</hi> but inſtead of a good Underſtanding, he groſly abuſed him, threatned to ſend him to Priſon on the Five-Mile Act, and ſaid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, <hi>The King had no Power to grant Licences to preach. March</hi> 29. an Uſher of <hi>Holland</hi> read Prayers that day, and ſoon after he began, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and Overſeers of <hi>Scarsbrick</hi> came to the Desk, clapt a Warrant on his Shoulder, and charged him to go with them to Juſtice <hi>E.</hi> who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him with a Priſon, and under-hand bad him go home. The Juſtice continued to give diſturbance to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> almoſt every Day, till <hi>December</hi> following; and upon <hi>Decemb.</hi> 19. ſent out his Warrant upon the Five-Mile Act, becauſe he dwelt within three Miles of <hi>Ormskirk,</hi> where he had been Miniſter. And on the Lord's Day, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 20. there came three Men (ſuch as they were) from Sir <hi>R. B.</hi> and him, about eleven of the Clock, while Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was in his Prayer before Sermon, walking up and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102446:32"/>down while Prayer was ended; then <hi>Rigby,</hi> one of them, came up to the Pulpit, and ſaid, <hi>Sir, you are our Priſoner come down, and go along with us.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deſired them to forbear till he had preached, and then he would ſubmit; but <hi>Rigby</hi> held his Piſtol to Mr. <hi>H.</hi>'s Head,<note place="margin">This is the Common-Prayer of theſe kind of Reformers, uſed more than the Liturgy.</note> and ſaid, <hi>God-damn-me, come down, Sirrab or I will crack your Pate.</hi> Mr. <hi>H.</hi> deſired him to be more civil; ſuch Language was unfit for that Place. Then the Lady, who with her Children and Servants ſtood at the Pulpit-door, required him to ſhew his Warrant, and told him, She might keep a Chaplain; and if he had no Authority but Guns, ſhe had Guns in the Houſe too. He ſhewed a written Warrant, which was obeyed: And the next day, the old Lady <hi>Stanley,</hi> and two Deputy-Lieutenants, and ſeveral Gentlemen, came and appeared for Mr. <hi>H.</hi> His living within three Miles of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Place, and preaching, being a Nonconformiſt, were urged againſt him: He defended himſelf with Argument, and it could not be proved, that he lived within three Miles: But the Thing inſiſted upon was, That he ſhould promiſe to preach no more. Several Junices ſtood for him; and one told his Proſecutors, If Mr. <hi>H.</hi> were ſent to <hi>Lancaſter</hi>-Goal, he ſhould be as comfortably maintained, and as honourably releaſed, as ever Priſoner was. At which the Proſecutor went off the Bench in a Rage, and went home, and ſent his Warrants to diſtrain for Twenty Pounds upon his Goods: The Doors were kept ſhut for half a Year, and the Officers were often chidden, (who alledged they had no Power to break open Doors) becauſe they did not get in, when they ſaw his Children playing in the Streets daily. His Perſon was kept from Goal, and his Goods-from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, but his Spirit could not be preſerved from great Grief, for he was heard to ſay, a little before he died, <hi>I think this turning out of our Licenſed Places will coſt</hi> Mr. Yates <hi>and me our Lives. O this goes heavily! Our caſting out of our great Places, was not ſo much as caſting us out of our little Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I leave the conſidering Reader to his Obſervations, which are obvious; only we plainly ſee, to what uſe the Laws are applied, and by whom executed.</p>
            <p>Here, as before, is to be ſeen the Irreverence which ſome Men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed towards his Majeſty's Power and Declaration; and to them I will add one more Inſtance of it: And becauſe it was ſo notorious, as to be brought before the King and Council, I need not be ſo ſhie to relate it, neither do I produce it as an Evidence of Diſloyalty to the King, which I will not impeach, nor of Zeal for the Laws, as of an Antipathy againſt ſome religious Things and Perſons.</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102446:32"/>
Mr. <hi>Sam. Doughty</hi> had the King's Licenſe to preach in his own Houſe, in <hi>Aſhby dela-Zouch,</hi> was convicted by the Lord <hi>B.</hi> and Lord <hi>S.</hi> Forty Pounds were levied upon him, twenty Pounds for his Houſe, and twenty Pounds for preaching in it. He made his Appeal to the Quarter-Seſſions, pleaded his Licenſe from the King, that there was neither Sedition, nor Breach of Peace; but he found no Relief. Afterwards he complained to the King and Council; the Lords were ſent for up to Council: The King was graciouſly pleaſed to give him his part, but he could never get it.</p>
            <p>The Loſſes by Nonconformity were very great, as being the Loſs of a ſetled Subſiſtence; but the Loſs by the Five-Mile Act was far greater, in many reſpects, to the poor ejected Miniſters, and their Families.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Mott,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Kings-Bromley,</hi> near <hi>Litchfield,</hi> was ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his People, from whom good Preferment, with the Urgency of Friends, could not allure him. After St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> he took a Farm of Sixty Pounds <hi>per an.</hi> in the ſaid Pariſh, on which be lived handſomly four Years, and was a good Tenant. But behold what a Crime it is to be a Nonconformiſt! He was threatned, and ſued by a Gentleman in the Pariſh and one of his Landlords turned againſt him, ſaying, It was not fit a Rebel againſt the King ſhould live ſo near the Church: And another of them, or the ſame, after he had made him a Promiſe to ſeal him a Leaſe for ſixteen Years, as ſoon as he returned from <hi>London;</hi> at <hi>London</hi> let the Eſtate to another, at the very ſame Rent, only he had a Watch in Earneſt of the Bargain; which Bargain ſtood, and the new Tenant turned out Mr. <hi>Mott,</hi> and his Family, to his great Loſs, and at once was forced to leave the Place where his Relations lived, himſelf was born, and had been a painful Miniſter. After this, he was accommodated with a part of his Wives Mother's Houſe in <hi>Stafford,</hi> where he lived in a very afflicted, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Condition, frowned upon by the Magiſtrates, (regulated Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates could do no leſs) threatning him with a Priſon, (for the bold Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of living in a Corporation, when he could live no where elſe.) When his Wife was big with Child, (of her ſixth) he was committed to the Marſhal's hand, becauſe he would not give in Bond, wherein he was required to renounce the Covenant, (no doubt that Bond was drawn by the Advice of Counſel learned in the Law, or rather did not the Arbitrary Spirit act in thoſe Counſels?) and further threatned to be ſent to <hi>Titbury</hi> Caſtle, to be ſafe there. But he was at about a Fortnight's end diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharged, when Reaſon and good Nature adviſed together, only paying his Fees, and the Charges of the Houſe. After this, the Corporation-Act came out; and what Malice without Law could not do before, this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102446:33"/>Law gratified the Malice of them, that thought a Corporation could not be ſafe, whilſt one Nonconformiſt was in it. He was then forced from his Wife and Children, came to them ſometimes privately; and if for many Years he appeared openly, Information was preſently given to the Magiſtrates, and he brought before the Mayor, and commanded to be gone, or ſtay in Priſon. Once he was brought before the Deputy-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; ſome told him (ſtrange News) that he was in a Plot; but he was diſmiſſed, upon his Promiſe of Appearance whenever required. So vigilant was the Eyes of ſome upon him, or ſevere was their Inſpection, that he hardly durſt attend the Funeral of his own Child, or ſtay to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his Wife under her Motherly Grief, occaſioned by that Loſs. Theſe Troubles, and Ceſſation from his former Work and Buſineſs, did affect him into a Decay of Health, and Oppreſſion of Spirits, that it haſtned his Death, as is verily believed.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Tho. Bakewell,</hi> Rector of <hi>Rolleſton,</hi> and afterwards Lecturer of <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> was ſuſpended by <hi>B. H.</hi> for preaching in his own Houſe, and was taken by a Warrant, together with Mr. <hi>Ford,</hi> (an eminent Miniſter, as he is ſaid to be) his then Auditor, and brought before Sir — who demanded Sureties for the Behaviour. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> asked, if Preaching was a Breach of the Behaviour? The Juſtice ſaid, It was: Then ſaid they both, We will give no Bond againſt Preaching. Upon which they were impriſoned ten Weeks, and releaſed without any Impoſition (of Bonds or Security.)</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act, he left his Wife and Family at <hi>Burton,</hi> and kept away for many Months, till be ſaw the Edg of his Adverſaries abate, preaching and ſhifting from Houſe to Houſe. When the King's Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration came out, he was invited to preach eight Miles off; and to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Officers, that had Warrants againſt him and the People, they congregated in Lanes, and wooddy Places: But the Huntſmen ſent their Dogs after them, from place to place, and took Names, and informed, and Diſtreſſes were made, for Perſons, but not for the Common on which they met, not being known to be in any Pariſh.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, That all one Summer, which was wet, they were not wet with Rain, while they met, inſomuch that the Country-People ſaid, They can have fair Weather to keep their Conventicles, when others could not get fair Weather to get in their Harveſt. He was confined to his own Houſe, as a Priſoner, not daring to go forth without great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, for ſome Years; and by ſtrange Providences, like <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> eſcaped great Dangers, and narrow Searches.</p>

Mr. <hi>Tho. Jollie,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Altham,</hi> upon his Ejection, broke up Houſe, and with three ſmall Children, was put to wander for a conſiderable time, without any certain Dwelling-Place. When he was a Sojourner at <hi>Healy, Octob</hi> 9. 1663, he was ſeized upon by a Lieutenant, and three Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in a rude manner, was ſet on Horſeback behind one of them, not permitted to draw on his Boots, nor put on his Hat: Theſe carried him to <hi>Burnley,</hi> and committed him to a Guard. He was examined about keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meetings, which could not be proved; but yet he muſt find Sureties for the Behaviour: and, as if that was too little, he muſt be ſent out of his Country. When he was at Family-Duty, in a Houſe to which he was committed by a Colonel, a Captain came in boyſterouſly, pretending it was a Conventicle, and with ſome Words of Blaſphemy, plucked the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of his hand, and drew him to the Court of Guard, where he muſt ſit all Night, inſulted over, and was not ſuffered to lie down till towards Day, when he was permitted to lie on a little moiſt Straw. He was, contrary to the Order of a Juſtice of Peace, and without the Command of the Colonel, ſet away on the Lord's Day, in extreme Rain, to <hi>Skippon</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> and there lay under the Marſhal's hand, till ſent back, becauſe the Officers there knew not to what purpoſe, or for what Cauſe he was committed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 4. 1663. he was taken Priſoner by three Troopers, not ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him any Warrant or Order, and not telling him whither they would have him, but carried him to <hi>York,</hi> and put him under the Marſhal's hand, who lodged him in a cold Room, without Fire, in the depth of Winter; and no Crime objected to him there: after a great Expence, and Hazard of his Life, he was ſent home in Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 12. 1664, he was taken at a Meeting by the ſame Captain; his Souldiers brake down the Doors by his Command. When the Captain came in among them, his Courage failed him, and his Countenance fell; ſo that he went away, and left Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to his Souldiers, one of whom <hi>(W.)</hi> raged againſt him in vile and bloody Expreſſions: Soon after which, he, and another Souldier were taken away by Death, in a terrible manner. He and others were carried before two Juſtices, who ſent him to <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Goal, where he continued the full Time appointed by the firſt Act againſt Conventicles.</p>
            <p>After his Releaſe, he was again (<hi>Novemb.</hi> 23. 1665.) ſeized, by Order from the Lord Lieutenant and Deputies, and by them turned over to the Juſtices, to give Bond for the Behavior, or to be ſent to Goal; but Juſtice <hi>Rigby</hi> confeſſed it was without Precedent, and therefore ſent him home, upon promiſe to ſurrender himſelf, if he ſent for him within a Fortnight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:102446:34"/>
After the Five-Mile Act came out, he was ſeparated from his Friends, and forced to leave his own Eſtate, and put to continual Night-Travels, to enjoy Divine Ordinances, for many Years, by which he contracted Diſeaſes, to the danger of his Life. Being upon a time taken Preaching, for which a Warrant of Baniſhment, for the third Offence, was ſent out againſt him; but it miſcarried, and he eſcaped.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 25. 1669, he was taken by Captain — and his Man, who brought him before ſome Deputy-Lieutenants, who ſent him to <hi>Lancaſter</hi> Goal for ſix Months, for preaching within five Miles of <hi>Altham,</hi> where he had been Miniſter.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October,</hi> he was ſued for Forty Pound, upon the Five-Mile Act, by the ſaid Captain <hi>N.</hi> which Suit coſt Mr. <hi>J.</hi> about Eighty Pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Decemb.</hi> 5. following, a Warrant of the Behaviour was ſerved upon Mr. <hi>J.</hi> for (as he ſaith) fulfilling his Miniſtry, in feeding his Flock, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſolemn Vow made at his Ordination.</p>
            <p>About <hi>June</hi> 14. 1674, before he knew his Licenſe from the King was out, he was taken preaching in one of his licenſed Places, by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>N.</hi> who commanded him to come down, or he would piſtol him, (holding his Piſtol at him in the Pulpit) and ſwearing blaſphemouſly, and calling him ſhamefully. After the Captain had detained him as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, (being made a Juſtice) he ſent forth a Warrant to diſtrain Twenty Pounds upon Mr. <hi>J.</hi>'s Goods; and becauſe his Goods were removed out of the way, he ſent out two Warrants, to diſtrain upon two of his Hearers; which Goods of theirs Mr. <hi>J.</hi> redeemed, becauſe taken inſtead of his. Another Warrant was ſent out for Twenty Pounds for the Houſe. The whole of the Fines for that Meeting came to about Forty four Pounds, which was all imbezelled, without paying to the King his part, or giving to the Poor theirs, ſave only one Forty Shillings. The King did graciouſly remit to the Sufferers his part; but the Captain would not obey the Order of the Lord Treaſurer: Yet this is for the King. The ſame is known to be true of a Juſtice in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About <hi>Novemb.</hi> 7. 1678. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> with ſeveral other Diſſenting Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, were preſented among the Plotting Papiſts: They made their Appearance, and deſired their Buſineſs, might be put off till the next Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the Juſtice granted, becauſe the Parliament had the Caſe of Diſſenters before them: Yet the Clerk of the Peace returned him and the reſt into the Exchequer, thereby (as he ſaith) cheating them out of their Liberty of Traverſe. This was chargeable to him, beſides the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration of two parts of his Eſtate, which he looked for, when he wrote the ſhort Narrative of his great Sufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:102446:34"/>
               <hi>N. B.</hi> Some have expoſed ſome of the Nonconformiſts to Jealouſy and Sufferings, as being confederate with Jeſuits, or maintaining a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and Intereſt with them; but this Nonconformiſt found no ſuch Friendſhip from that Party: For Mr. <hi>W.</hi> of <hi>Druſenhaugh,</hi> a great Papiſt in his Pariſh, charged his Steward, a Papiſt alſo, to ſhut him out of <hi>Lango</hi> Chappel, where he was Lord of the Soil. His Adverſaries were great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates with the Popiſh Gentry, which are numerous in that County; and ſome of his Adverſaries had been profeſſed Papiſts a while before.</p>
            <p>There are many very remarkable Inſtances of God's Providence towards him, and of the inſatiable Malice of very ill Men againſt him; with the Divine Hand ſtretched out againſt ſeveral of his Perſecutors.</p>
            <p>Two Captains, Gentlemen, and an Enſign hindred him to preach, or commend his People to God, before <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. 1662. after thirteen Years labouring among his People. He withdrew, and gave way to their Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, leaving this Admonition with one of the Gentlemen: <hi>This is not the way to turn the Wrath of God from your Houſe, which hath long lain upon it, but to bring it on to the uttermoſt.</hi> The Gentleman anſwered, <hi>Be it ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their Carriage towards Mr. <hi>Jollie</hi> was an Offence and great Grief to the Country.</p>
            <p>One of the three Excluders of him died in the purſuit of his moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Practices, with unexpreſſible Horrors.</p>
            <p>Soon after another of them, whom he had warned as before, died (having ſeen his Male Iſſue rooted out before) by his own hands, by a Relapſe into exceſſive Drinking, after a little Recovery. His Diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him, as if he had been ſtruck with a Rod upon his Arm.</p>
            <p>Another (but not one of the three) violent Proſecutor died in great Poverty and Diſgrace.</p>
            <p>A younger Brother, and next Heir to the admoniſhed Gentleman, was the Cauſe of Mr. <hi>J.</hi>'s Apprehenſion, <hi>April</hi> 25. 1669. who not being well, would needs have his Chamber-Window in <hi>A. H.</hi> opened to ſee Mr. <hi>J.</hi> carried by a Priſoner; but ſuch an Air came in at the Window upon him, that he took cold, and ſoon after died, without any male Iſſue: And ſaith the good Man, <hi>Lord grant the third Brother may take warning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Gentleman, that ſent Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Priſoner to <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> was ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after made a Priſoner, and all his Eſtate in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſeized upon for Debt.</p>
            <p>One <hi>F.</hi> a Retainer to Capt. <hi>N.</hi> and an Inſtrument in the Proſecution, a drunken and debauched Fellow, after a Revelling-Bout at the <hi>Ab.</hi> in <hi>W.</hi> was taken or ſmitten with an inſatiable Thirſt, inſomuch that two days after he lay down and drunk at the River, to quench his Thirſt, upon which a Stitch took him, and killed him preſently.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:102446:35"/>
About the latter end of 1677, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> a Juſtice, met at a Privy-Seſſions, at which one of the Juſtices asked, Who Mr. <hi>J.</hi> was? Another anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He is a Miuiſter: <hi>No,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>R. he is an Enemy of Chriſt, and a Traitor to the King.</hi> Preſently after (as ſome preſent are ready to teſtify) that Gentleman fell a trembling, could not hold his Pen to ſign any War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nor ſit up, nor ſtay in the Place, but was neceſſitated to leave the Seſſions, and never came more to the Bench, dying ſoon after, as a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spectacle.</p>
            <p>The ſame worthy Perſon concludes a ſhort Sum of his Sufferings thus; <hi>We might give an Account of the ſpecial hand of God upon us for Good, all along, throughout all our Infirmities and Temptations, leading us by the hand, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding us, either ſignally ſaving us from, or ſtrengthning us under our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, filling us with Peace paſſing underſtanding, and Joy unſpeakable, ſupplying our Wants every way, who are a very weak and poor People. — Yea, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing or changing our Adverſaries, or baffling and blaſting their Deſigns. — All this for the everlaſting Honour of his moſt glorious Name alone.</hi> Hallelujah.</p>
            <p>Compare the Spirit of the Proſecutors, and the Spirit of the Sufferers, the End of the one, and of the other, and then judg ſeriouſly, who is the beſt Chriſtian, and who is moſt approved of Chriſt, they who ſerve him, or the other who trouble them for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>T. M.</hi> of <hi>L.</hi> (I conceal his Name becauſe of his Modeſty) in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending his Letter at the Importunity of his Friend, thus he begins: <hi>Honoured Sir, were it not for the falſe Reflections and Calumnies againſt the Nonconformiſt-Miniſters of</hi> England, — <hi>your kind and ſerious, ſympathizing, and ſeaſonable Letter had not extorted theſe ſad following Lines. — I am in ſome ſort compelled to comply with your Importunity, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing epitomiz'd Narrative.</hi> And he concludes with a Spirit that commands from me a great reſpect to his Chriſtian and humble Temper.</p>
            <p>He left his Living in the City of <hi>L.</hi> where he had been a Miniſter ſome Years, having a Wife and ſeveral Children, loſt 80 <hi>
                  <abbr>l.</abbr> per an.</hi> and 40 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> which ſhould have been paid to him in the beginning of the Year, and in a low Eſtate left his Living: Yet he continued in Town, living upon meer Providence, till the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act came out. Then he was forced to leave Wife and Children, being ſcarce free from an almoſt deadly Cold, which he thought would put an end to his Life, continuing about three Months upon him. He ſaw not Wife nor Children after that in eleven Weeks, and durſt not come to them publickly in eighteen Months, or thereabouts, and having no Dwelling-place abroad, journeyed in that time (as he thinks) thirteen ſcore Miles on foot, from place to place. If at any time he ſhould ſteal home by Night, he was in great fear and danger, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102446:35"/>durſt not ſtir out of his Chamber; and whenever he went out again, he went either very late, or very early, and ſometimes on a ſudden, for fear of being taken. After that time he made bold to come home; but the Zeal of ſome growing ſo hot, that one Mr. <hi>Grace,</hi> an aged worthy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, coming to Town, they made ſearch for him, which he eſcaped, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Horſe in his Inn, and eſcaping on foot: Then Mr. <hi>M.</hi> thought it unſafe for him to ſtay, and made haſte away the next day, and durſt not return in a long time. One time he was ſent for to a Magiſtrate that lay ſick, and continued his Night-Viſits for a Fortnight; but the Evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, he was ſent for in haſte by Day-light; and becauſe he was ſeen to go to the Magiſtrate's Houſe, he was complained of to the chief Magiſtrate of the Town, by a Curate, which made him haſten away next morning, <hi>(Saturday):</hi> The chief Magiſtrate was ſo kind as to ſend notice to his Wife, on the Evening of the Sabbath, that her Husband ſhould be gone, for ſome had been twice with him for a Warrant. After this he abſented long. He was cited into the Eccleſiaſtical Court, for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing his own Child. One time as he was going along the Street, one cried out to the Town-Clerk, who went after him, <hi>Do you ſee the Rogue Mr.</hi> R. <hi>do you ſee the Rogue? He is before you:</hi> But God was pleaſed to give the Town-Clerk another Heart than to apprehend him. But this made him be much from home, and walk the Streets very ſparingly. He hath been forced into the Country in Snow and Rain, to preach before day, and to ſhift from Houſe to Houſe before day, for fear of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the Country, who hath ſaid, he would have him dead or alive. And ſo not daring to be in the City, nor to appear in the Country, in that Magiſtrate's reach, he hath been conſtrained to retire into the Fields and Solitudes, to keep Sabbath all alone. He hath lived upon Providence for eighteen or nineteen Years; and tho <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

With many other pious Expreſſions of God's Goodneſs, and wonderful Providences, his own Unworthineſs, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be counted a Sufferer, he concludes to his worthy Friend with Praiſes and Prayer.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned Mr. <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Sheerſton,</hi> as an aged worthy Miniſter, I remember ſome ſhort Account of him, which take as followeth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Grace,</hi> upon his Ejectment from his Living, on which he lived comfortably, was with his Wife and eleven Children reduced to Straits. Hoping to get ſome Supplies of Maintenance, he took a Farm of about
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:102446:36"/>Thirty Pounds <hi>per an.</hi> — (But preaching in his own Houſe was, it ſeems by his Letter, a Crime not to be paſſed by.) He was in a ſhort time after his other Troubles, apprehended by two Juſtices,<note place="margin">Noncenformity is ſuch a great Sin in ſome Mens eyes, that it excludes them out of natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well as Charity and Compaſſion. This worthy Perſon was ſo near a-kin to A. B. <hi>Sh.</hi> that he and his Family could not be much nearer. Either he or his Wife was Couſin-German to the late A. B. of <hi>Cant.</hi>
               </note> and, with many of his Hearers, bound over, which was very chargeable. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he was ſent for by a Party of Horſe, called out of his Bed, and carried Priſoner to <hi>Stafford,</hi> for what he knew not, nor was ever told. He being unable to bear the Charge of his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made application to the Deputy-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, was forced to give in Bond of a hundred Pounds, to appear when called. He was diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, after many hard Speeches, but no Charge laid againſt him. After theſe Troubles, he was by the Five-Mile-Act neceſſitated to remove five Miles from the Corporation, to a Place where he lived at great Coſts and Charges, ſeparated from his dear Relations, and his Farm left to the management of Servants, which proved exceedingly to his Loſs.</p>
            <p>Some Nonconformiſts in the North of <hi>England</hi> have been often impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. Eight were indicted for <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> and their Eſtates ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred: Their Proof and Plea, that they were true Proteſtants,<note place="margin">When will the Jeſuits and Papiſts be at this pains and charge to prove themſelves Proteſtants?

They were indicted upon the Statute of Twenty Pound a Month, and Twelve-pence a Sunday.

               </abbr>) due at the ſeveral Offices, they had been great Sufferers, and their ſtreight Condition had been reduced I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell into what Streights and Poverty, they being no ways able to pay it; for even what was paid, was raiſed by the Charity of good People in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Man that hath any value for the precious Souls of Men, for whom Chriſt died, and hath any knowledg of the miſerable Condition of large and dark Places in thoſe Counties, he may judg it to be a great Diſſervice
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102446:36"/>to Jeſus Chriſt, and immortal Souls, to ſilence, impriſon, and puniſh Preachers, and thereby to leave poor ignorant Souls to the Improvements of natural Ignorance, and to the Power of ill Examples, and irreligious or ſuperſtitious Cuſtoms. A Traveller, unacquainted with the Country, is not in greater danger in the Night, of falling into Cole-Pits and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices, than thoſe poor Souls of falling into the Bottomleſs-Pit, if they are denied the Guidance of faithful Miniſters. Shall poor Souls abide in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and err from the Ways of God, to their everlaſting hazard? and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that have knowledg of their Danger, and a charitable Senſe of their great Need, look on, and ſee them fall, and ſin, and die, and not call, and warn, and exhort, and teach them? Their painful Miniſters, to avoid Offence and Dangers, and to ſhew poor Souls the Way to everlaſting Life, have gone under the protection and concealment of the Darkneſs of the Night, and preached and prayed in Caves and Pits, venturing their Healths and Lives, to ſave Sinners from everlaſting Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>One Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> in <hi>Cumberland</hi> preached in one of them, and got a Cold that proved mortal, leaving ſix Children to the Charity of good People, and particularly to the Care of Mr. <hi>Richard Wilſon,</hi> a Gentleman of a ſmall Eſtate, but of great Piety and Uſefulneſs in the North, and one who had like to have been ruined on the 35 of <hi>Eliz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what a poor Reward is a Threatning, a Frown, a Fine, and an Impriſonment! Is this a Prophet's Reward! Not to receive them that ſpeak Peace, into their Houſes, is an Unkindneſs: To bid them depart out of their Coaſt, is a fairer diſmiſſion than to ſend them to a Priſon. If their Rewards be only in this Life, then of all Men, they who are puniſhed in thoſe and other dark and poor Corners of the Land, are moſt miſerable.</p>
            <p>Active and ſucceſsful Mr. <hi>Tho. Tregoſſe</hi> writes thus to his Brother-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: <hi>Warrants are granted for levying Two Hundred and Twenty Pounds upon me; yet God hath kept them off, but I am expecting daily to be ſtript of all; I am alſo threatned upon the Corporation-Law. — I am conſtantly expecting an Impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To avoid that Miſchief, and others which he expected, ſome have removed often from Place to Place. It is not painful to ambitious Men, to remove from a worſe to a better, from an old to a new Preferment; but Removes are chargeable and burthenſom, from a Free-Hold to a Farm, to a Chamber, or a part of another Man's Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (<hi>Life of Mrs.</hi> M. B. <hi>p.</hi> 51.) hiſtorically tells us of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Removes, which muſt needs be very troubleſom to his ſickly Body, and to his Mind fixed upon Studies; and to have no better Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, than a part of a very poor Houſe of a Farmer's in <hi>Totteridge,</hi> where the Rooms ſmoak'd ſo extremely, as greatly annoyed the Health of the nobly charitable Mrs. <hi>Baxter.</hi> The Winter was very hard and cold, the Coal-ſmoak filled the Room in which they ſate all day, ſo that it was as a Cloud, and they were even ſuffocated with the Stink. It was ill li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving without Fire in a cold Winter, and bad having Smoak in their Eyes, and Stink in their Noſtrils: It was ill ſtudying for him, in great pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; and ill living for her, whoſe Lungs could not bear Smoak and Cloſeneſs.</p>
            <p>It doth as often affect me, as I call to mind what Reverend Mr. <hi>T.</hi> writes, in a Letter to a Relation. — <hi>I am now</hi> ſeptuagenarius, <hi>and hardly able to paſs from one Chamber to another, without ſome help, over and above that of my Staff. Being driven out of my Place, worth above Two Hundred Pounds</hi> p. 1 an. <hi>with my Wife and eight Children, and by forced Confinements, and ſometimes Baniſhments, for the ſpace of a whole Year from my Houſe and Family, did contract thoſe Weakneſſes and Diſtempers, under which I now lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. But ſtill I have cauſe to bleſs God, who corrects me far leſs than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; and why ſhall a living Man complain?</hi>

            <p>Take another Inſtance of the Effects of Confinements upon the Health and Life of ſome more, and upon their Families.</p>
            <p>The well-known Divine, Mr. <hi>G. Hughes</hi> of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> was ſummoned to <hi>appear</hi> by a Lieutenant of the Garriſon, as from his Superior, and to bring his Son with him. An Officer, with two Files of Musquetiers, was commanded to convey Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to an Iſland in the Sea, not ſuffering his Son (to be his Companion and Comforter) to go with him, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined him to <hi>Plimouth.</hi> While Mr. <hi>H.</hi> was in the Iſland, the Earl of <hi>B.</hi> came upon it; but Mr. <hi>H.</hi> could not obtain the Juſtice or Friendſhip to ſpeak with him, tho nothing was laid to his Charge. Here in his <hi>Patmos</hi> he anſwered Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi>'s <hi>Sure-Footing.</hi> And here that Diſeaſe, by the Saltneſs of the Air, poſſeſſed him, that never left him: His Legs were black and ſwollen, and could not be recovered. After nine Months Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, he was offered his Liberty, upon condition of giving Security of a Thouſand Pounds, not to live within Twenty Miles of <hi>Plimouth.</hi> He yeilded to the Importunity of his Friends, who gave that Bond with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his knowledg, to ſee if better Air would relieve him, and came in a languiſhing condition to take his leave of his Friends, and the Place of his Miniſtry, and removed to a Place twenty Miles off, and there died.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Tho. Martin,</hi> Lecturer of St. <hi>Andrew Plimouth,</hi> 1661, (certainly ſo good and innocent a Man as I took him to be could not provoke any Man, much leſs Authority) was, upon a rigorous Interpretation of Words, ſuſpended <hi>ab Officio;</hi> and one time it being given out, that he intended to preach, was threatned by a Man, who carried Anger in his Breaſt, and a Sword at his Side, to be pluck'd out of the Pulpit by the Ears.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1665, he, together with Mr. <hi>Hughes,</hi> Vicar of that Church, was ſent to the Iſland, and kept Priſoner under very hard Circumſtances, for ten Months, in which he, his deſolate Wife, and eight Children, ſuffered much Diſcomfort, and his Eſtate a great Impairing. He humbly deſired a Removal, when the Sickneſs was among the Souldiers, and ſome of them very near his Lodging, which was denied. But at length, for the ſake of Liberty from ſuch a Reſtraint, by the Command of the E. of <hi>B.</hi> he gave Bond of a Thouſand Pounds, and two Sureties to his Majeſty, not to inhabit in, or to come within twenty Miles of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> without his or his Deputy's leave. He and his Family ſuffered great Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by their Separation from one another; and when his Preſence was neceſſary to adviſe, relieve, and comfort his Family, in Sickneſſes, and Death of ſome, he durſt not come any nearer to them. In all this time he was not accuſed of any Crime, or Breach of Law or Statute, and was never admitted to come before the E. of <hi>B.</hi> about this Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not collect Stories out of what is publiſhed to the World, nor ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all which might be ſoon brought together; but I ſhall communicate one Story more, to ſhew them that knew not the Temper of the Times, and to what we may impute many of our Diviſions and Miſeries, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth taking notice of.</p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>N. S.</hi> had ſpent divers Years in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and had been legally ordained by Epiſcopal Hands, he returned to <hi>P.</hi> the Place of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, of his Anceſtor's Abode, where his Eſtate and his Relations lived, and betook to his private Studies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102446:38"/>
Two Officers of the Garriſon came from the Governour (as they ſaid) to his Lodging, (<hi>Octob.</hi> 6. 1665.) and told him, the Governor deſired to ſpeak with him at the P. Tavern: Mr. <hi>S.</hi> haſted thither, where he found divers Miniſters on the ſame Buſineſs. After they had been there a while, they perceived a Guard of Souldiers was put upon them. <hi>Octob.</hi> 9. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> with others, were removed to the Fl. Tavern. Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> was rudely treated by the Serjeant, for offering to ſtep to his Lodging without his leave. The Serjeant that Night doubled the Guard, and ſet two Sentinels at his Chamber, and the Liberty of the Houſe was denied him. In the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he was conveyed with four Muſquetiers, with their Matches lighted, to the Col. who conveyed him to St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Iſland, with Orders from the E. not to converſe with Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> Priſoners there, and to have a Sentinel ſet at his Chamber-Door, and not to go out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without a Guard. He continued under this Reſtraint, till <hi>Decemb.</hi> 4. In <hi>January</hi> he was brought before the Earl, who told him, If he could ſatisfy the Biſhop, he would be ſatisfied. The Biſhop knowing him in <hi>Oxford,</hi> wrote a very obliging Letter to the Earl, as much in his favour as could be. The Oath in the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act was tendred him, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, as not concerned in the Act it ſelf, when the Act came forth, not then in being. His Priſon was changed, and <hi>March</hi> 30. was releaſed upon his Bond to depart the Town within forty eight hours.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Worts,</hi> (commended as a worthy Perſon, by a Gentleman able to judg) Paſtor of a Congregation at <hi>Gueſtwick</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> was impriſoned by a Writ <hi>De Excommun. capiend.</hi> taken out <hi>Novemb.</hi> 15. 1664. and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Common-Goal till <hi>Septemb.</hi> 3. 1665. when the Plague was at the height in <hi>London,</hi> he was made cloſe Priſoner until <hi>Novemb.</hi> 9. not knowing by whoſe Order, or for what additional Offence. <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. he, with ſix more, were put into the Caſtle, in a Hole in the Wall, over an Arch, on the Weſt ſide of the Caſtle, which had neither Door, Window, nor Chimney. There was room in a Corner for one Truckle-Bed, the reſt lay in Hammocks. The Hole had three Wickets into the Felon's Yard, one of which muſt be open Night and Day, leſt they ſhould have been ſtiffled in the Night with the Steam of the Charcoal. For five Weeks the Door below (for the Hole is about forty Steps high, up a narrow Paſſage in the Wall) was kept lock'd Night and Day. The Keeper uſually went away about four of the Clock with the Key to a Neighbour-Village, about a Mile and half diſtance from the Head-Goaler's Houſe, and returned not till about eight in the Morning, in whoſe abſence none could come to them, whatever occaſion might be. During thoſe five Weeks, they were not permitted to ſet foot into the Yard. If a Priſoner's
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102446:38"/>Wife came to ſee him, he was called down to the Door, and the Keeper would ſet his Back againſt one ſide of the Door, and his Foot againſt the other, and ſo the Husband and Wife might only ſee and ſpeak with each other. They had leave to run up and down Stairs as oft as they would, which was inſtead of a Walk or Gallery for the ſpace of five Weeks. Their Maid was not allowed to come up with their Proviſion. After the five Weeks, theſe Perſons were permitted to go into the Caſtle-Yard, during the time of their continuance there, which was about two Months; then they were removed to another Priſon. They were wonderfully preſerved this Year from the Contagion, while the Arrows of the Almighty fell mortally very near them, an one ſide and another, there being only a Lane between, ſo that they could both hear and ſee ſome that were ſhut up, crying for Bread, and themſelves ſhut up alſo, and could not flee, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into their Strong-Tower, the Name of the Lord, where they found Safety and Peace. Some time after a great Man, then in Power, told the Goaler, he muſt carry them forthwith to the Caſtle, and put up each in a Place alone: The Goaler anſwered, <hi>It cannot be done, the Caſtle is full, and I daily fear the Plague ſhould break out amongst them:</hi> He replied, <hi>Then put them into a Place together,</hi> adding, <hi>What do I care if the Plague be in it.</hi> Yet were they preſerved in that naſty Hole, at whoſe Wickets came in the odious excrementitious Odors of the Common-Yard of the Felons. One of them was even ſuffocated by it; the Phyſician could not help, ſo long as the Patient was put up there: Upon which an Account was ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to the Sheriff of his low Eſtate, with a Petition to remove him for a little time, his Life being in danger: The Sheriff anſwered, He durſt not meddle, he muſt abide it: The Man revived notwithſtanding, and lived.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Worts</hi> continued Priſoner full ſeven Years, as the Gentleman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members, from whom I have this Narrative, and who had it from Mr. <hi>W.</hi> while a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved by the Reverend and intelligent Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> that many have been excommunicated in the Dioceſs of <hi>Norwich,</hi> (and there was a ſevere Proſecution of the Excommunicate) but to the honour of that moſt excellent Evangelical Biſhop <hi>Reynolds,</hi> it is obſerved thoſe Proceedings were not from him, who retained that good Spirit which he diſcovered, when he preached thoſe and other compoſing and healing Sermons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and upon the King's Reſtauration. The Guilt of this Severity and Inhumanity is imputed to Dr. <hi>M.</hi> Chancellor of the Dioceſs, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon his Greatneſs under the Uſurpation; but the Chancellor was moſt away, and left the Management of the Office to inferior Officers,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102446:39"/>which was a great Trouble to the good Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Who doth not ſee, that ſome Great Men have ventured to exerciſe an Arbitrary Power? and what Remedy for the Oppreſſed? This Greatneſs was too big for a High-Sheriff, the King's higheſt Repreſentative in his County, to oppoſe or offend, by an Act of Juſtice and Mercy. Such Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities have been uſed as much without the knowledg of the King, as contrary to his Nature, (and perhaps others in ſuperior Power have been abuſed by their Inferiors) who declared himſelf to be againſt ſanguinary Laws, in the Caſe of Mr. <hi>Holdcraft,</hi> (who was a Priſoner many Years in <hi>Cambridg</hi> Caſtle, and threatned with Baniſhment or Death, on 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi>) and was heard to ſay, It was a barbarous Act in the Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to be againſt the removal of worthy Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> out of a loathſom Chamber above a Privy, when ſick of a high Fever, of which he died, in <hi>Briſtol</hi>-Goal. His Royal Clemency extended far into the Weſt, in the Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. <hi>Tregoſſe,</hi> by a ſpecial Order to the Marſhal of <hi>Bodmin,</hi> which was a noted Anſwer to his Prayers; and who releaſed Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Fine at the Interceſſion of the Lord <hi>Newport.</hi> The Juſtice of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Judges, and of ſome Deputy-Lieutenants, and Juſtices, who have qualified the Heats of others, deſerves an honourable Obſervation, and they have as great a Share in the Honour of being of the Government, as they who arrogate to themſelves the ſole or eminent Title, that a Man cannot relate their extravagant Miſcarriages, but they are ready to arraign him as a petty Traytor againſt the Government, thereby to keep Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers in awe, from making Complaints, or ſpeaking Truth. But ſome particular Perſons have given all the Vent they could to their Enmity againſt Nonconformiſt-Miniſters; if not againſt Religious Duties, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them beyond the Boundaries of Law.</p>
            <p>Some acting upon the Act of Uniformity beyond Law, have been reſtleſs till they procured an Act againſt Conventicles. Great Complaints were made of the Nonconformiſts Meetings, when Sir <hi>Edward Turner,</hi> the Speaker, preſented the Bill againſt Conventicles, (the firſt Act) he told his Majeſty: <q>Whilſt we were intent upon theſe weighty Affairs, we were often interrupted by Petitions, and Letters, and Motions, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the unſetled Condition of ſome Counties, by reaſon of Phanaticks, Sectaries, and Nonconformiſts: They differ in their Shapes and Species, and accordingly are more or leſs dangerous; but in this <hi>they all agree,</hi> they are no Friends to the eſtabliſhed Government in Church or State. He calls Conventicles, the Seed-Plots and Nurſeries of their Opinions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Religious Worſhip.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102446:39"/>
From the few Narratives given in before, and an ordinary Obſervation of Times, and the Knowledg we have how eaſy a thing it is to procure Addreſſes, Motions, Petitions, for any thing, and againſt any thing, which ſome great Men would have, we may imagine from what kind of Men ſuch Repreſentations were made. And conſidering that ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation thus made to the King, ſo long a Stranger in his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by a Speaker in Parliament, it is wonderful, the King did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to an utter Extirpation of all Nonconformiſts, as Enemies to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and no Lovers of his Perſon, in whom the Regality is inveſted. And to tell the King, that all Nonconformiſts are no Friends to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Government, was to motion a fair Reward of the Loyalty of very many, who uſed all Endeavours to reſtore his Majeſty and Government; and to contradict what the King himſelf told the Miniſters of <hi>London,</hi> on the Day of his happy Return, when the Reverend Mr. <hi>A. Jackron</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a Bibe in their behalf, as he paſſed through St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Church-Yard, to this effect, <hi>That he muſt attribute his Reſtauration, under God, to their Prayers and Endeavours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſpiritual Antipathy againſt good Men hath been very troubleſom to many wiſe and moderate Magiſtrates, and preſſed out all the Sowrneſs of ſome Mens Spirits into the Cup of the Nonconformiſts, and forced milder Natures into an obſequious Severity to Pride and Anger, which could not be reſtrained from falling on theſe Men, that were to be ſet at naught; and they who ſhewed them reſpects, forfeited the Civilities due to themſelves.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Head with a few Inſtances of this Antipathy and Incivility.</p>
            <p>A wealthy Citizen, of very good quality, in time of the Plague went to viſit his native Country, and ſecretly to diſtribute his Charity, which was proportionable to his Eſtate and Mind; and being in a Town in the Aſſize time, was brought before ſome Juſtices of the Peace; theſe demanded Bond for his Behaviour, or elſe he muſt to Priſon. He underſtanding himſelf, and being conſcious there was no cauſe of Impriſonment, refuſed the firſt, and having a good Spirit, a good Purſe, and good Counſel, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped the laſt.</p>
            <p>After the <hi>Oxford</hi> Act came out, a peaceable and inoffenſive Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt was conſtrained to think of a Removal from a convenient Settlement. He was neceſſitated to leave his Family, which Separation was next to an Exile to him, and when he could come home, to come in the Night.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102446:40"/>He employed his Friends, and rode about himſelf, to find an Habitation. After much enquiry he was directed to a very good convenient Houſe, which he was glad of, with reſpect to his Wife, who was a worthy Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and bore her part of his Sufferings with decency and affection. The Landlord was a Courtier. The Miniſter took the Houſe of him that was entruſted to let it, gave Earneſt, brewed, and prepared for his Settlement; but before he could remove, a Gentleman of that Neighbourhood, who had no power either to let or hinder, came and hung a Lock upon the Door of the Houſe, and wrote a Letter to the Landlord at <hi>London,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with what he had done, and begging his Pardon for the Preſumption, for he thought <hi>it was not fit that a Nonconformiſt ſhould be his Tenant.</hi> Surely this Gentleman looked upon a Nonconformiſt, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> and would deny him Water, or not receive him into his Houſe, or bid him <hi>God ſpeed.</hi> And ſo the Gentleman was to ſeck again for an Habitation, to his great perplexity and trouble.</p>
            <p>A Gentleman of Quality and Truth gave me this Relation of one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own knowledg: One, (ſaith he) a very worthy Perſon, was ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſed with Witchcraft, which the Witch confeſſing, was brought before ſome Juſtices, one of whom (ſaid to be a famous Perſecutor) bad her go home, and <hi>if ſhe bewitched none but Fanaticks, ſhe ſhould never be troubled for him.</hi> And ſo he had no relief from the Law, nor Eaſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, till the Witch died, ſeveral Years after.</p>
            <p>Did they who ſo ſtrongly brought in our Terms, foreſee that there would be Nonconformiſts, and that Nonconformity would not only eject them out of their Habitations and Benefices, but out of Corporations, and their own hired Houſes, but exclude them out of the common Right of Humanity and Juſtice, then they have the greater cauſe to repent: If they did not, they are the more innocent Cauſes of many and great Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to many truly good Men, and are engaged to endeavour their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from all theſe Troubles.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that the moſt active Inſtruments in this Anti-Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Work, have been none of the beſt, but indeed the worſt of Men.</p>
            <p>And of them it may be noted, (1.) What their Quality is, and hath been. (2.) What their Impiety, and heinous Wickedneſs, of the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Nature. (3.) What their Succeſs hath been. (4.) What Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been of God againſt them, and what their Ends have been. Some of them have been convinced, converted, and taken off from this Way and Courſe; and ſome have been made Examples of humane and divine Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:102446:40"/>
There are abundance of inferior Officers, that are very vicious and diſhoneſt, and yet nothing is to be ſeen very remarkably differing them from other vicious and poor People; but that of all Sorts of Inſtruments theſe Informers ſhould be noted out by Divine Providence, as Examples of notorious Vices, Falſhood, Perjuries, and miſerable Deaths, may be a Warning to the worſt of Men, not to grow ſo bad, and bold againſt the Ways of God.</p>
            <p>It is not neceſſary to refer the following Narratives unto the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Heads; I ſhall not pretend to ſo much unprofitable Exactneſs, but relate what is well atteſted, in a promiſcuous way.</p>
            <p>About the Year 1674, about twenty five Perſons, Men and Women, were indicted for a Rout or Riot in <hi>Stafford-ſhire,</hi> (that is to ſay, for a Meeting for Religious Exerciſe): The Proſecutors were, <hi>Thomas Ward,</hi> Bayliff to the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> (executed for Treaſon, and the Popiſh Plot) and five more, whereof one died immediatly, others loſt their Places, and others came to Poverty.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Holmes,</hi> an Informer, hunting to find out Mr. <hi>Bakewell</hi>'s Meeting in the Night, fell into a Pit of Water, and was in danger to be drowned, had not ſome helped him out; which Danger did operate upon him, ſo as to ſay, that he would go no more upon that account.</p>
            <p>And Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Miniſter of <hi>B.</hi> met Mr. <hi>Bakewell,</hi> and profeſſed he was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for any thing he either ſaid or did againſt him, to bring him into Trouble.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved, That thoſe who became Enemies to Mr. <hi>Bakewell</hi> of <hi>Burton,</hi> had been Profeſſors of Piety, but fell from it, and they fell into great and apparent Decays of Eſtates, even to Poverty. [<hi>Note,</hi> Moſt commonly they who never made a ſhew of Piety, or fell from it, trke the way of Informing.] — Godlineſs is gainful, and hath the Promiſe of the Life that now is; but Ungodlineſs hath the contrary Curſes.</p>
            <p>I will confirm this Obſervation with a fearful Example of Apoſtacy and Wickedneſs, moſt remarkably puniſhed, with Ruine of a good Eſtate, and a moſt miſerable ſhameful Death.</p>
            <p>The Narrative was communicated to me by a Gentleman of great Worth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Hunnucks</hi> of <hi>Braintree</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> was the Son of a ſerious, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly pious, wealthy Draper and Grocer in that Town. A pious Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Example had little Efficacy upon him; but being witty, and capable of the Management of his own and his Father's Trade, was left Co-Executor with his Mother-in-Law, who prudently agreed with him,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102446:41"/>to get into her own hands her Part, and the Portion of one Child. He married the Daughter of a very worthy Perſon, had four Children by her, obſerved Family-Duties, and wanted not Gifts, was wont to go ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to hear the Nonconformiſts, who were afterwards perſecuted by him.</p>
            <p>Not many Months after his Wife died, he grew wild and debauched, ſwearing, drinking, and with his drawn Sword forcing others to drink up to his Meaſure. He was very vexatious to his Dealers, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Trade, unnatural and unjuſt in detaining his Siſter's Portion, compelling her Husband to go to Law, forſwearing himſelf about his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Will, that it was loſt, and that his Father died in Debt as much as the Eſtate would ſatisfy, which was prized at 2200 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> beſides 4 or 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> brought in as bad Debts, the moſt of which this Man recovered. He ſued his Brother-in-Law, arreſted him, and in perſon goes with the Bayliff to ſee him in Priſon, not ceaſing to put him to great Charges, till his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law died. In nine or ten Years time he conſumed all his Father left him and his other Children, ran far into Debt, and caſt himſelf into the King's-Bench.</p>
            <p>The firſt Lord's Day after the Act againſt Conventicles came in force, he began to inform, and (as was ſaid) he reckoned to get Sixty Pounds <hi>per</hi> Week by that good Work, after the failing of other Trades. But God would have ſtopp'd him, if his Heart had not been hardned; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Lord's-Day came, one of his Children looking into a Tub of Water, fell into it, and was drowned. When he heard of it in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, he made no haſte home; and when he came, he bad his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that came to ſee if they could recover the Child, be gone, they had no Buſineſs there. The Child (as is remembred) was buried on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday, and the next day he went and informed the Officers of a Meeting, with Witneſſes to atteſt his Information. The Officers charged him to go along with them, and forced him in, (he being unwilling to go in when he came to the Door,) and ſhew them the People: When he came in, they ſhoved him up over againſt the Preacher, he would neither look up, nor ſpeak, but fell a trembling. The Officers cried, <hi>This is your Informer,</hi> he anſwered, <hi>I am no Informer, I will be no Informer.</hi> But being reproached for his Faint-heartedneſs, and animated by ſome, he came again the next Lord's Day, and continued the greateſt part of that Summer with great Fury, taking ſome with him, riding about, and ſearching, to the Expence of about Fifty Pounds, but not getting Five, (a thriving Trade!) Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this Time he grew more debauched and vile, reckoning this amongſt his Glories, that he had converted, and brought more to Church than all the Preachers. 'Tis ſaid, he fillip'd up a Shilling, to ſee whether he ſhould
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102446:41"/>go to God or the Devil, as that fell Croſs or Pile. He hath ſworn he would kill the Preacher, and forſworn himſelf often, ſwearing ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be at the Meeting, who were not, but divers Miles off. When one Mr. <hi>Bromball,</hi> an aged pious Man, was to be buried, he provided ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fidlers to go to the Burial-Houſe, where he pranced with his Horſe before the Door, and broke the Windows with his Staff, and would have the Fidlers go along with him, playing by the Corps, with Language fitted for his Mouth and Actions.</p>
            <p>He found no Succeſs or Advantage by his Informing, but about a Year after God took him to a Reckoning: He was broken and blaſted in his Body, as before in his Eſtate; his Eyes ſunk in their Holes, and his Fleſh conſumed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that he was not known to his Acquaintance; his Strength failed him, that he could not go abroad; he caſt away his Eſtate, and his Friends caſt him off: And now what place was left to receive him? None, but a common lower Room in a poor Hoſtler's Houſe, in the Noiſe and Company of poor rude Children. Thus his Pride was ſtained and humbled. But his Heart ſeemed to be more humbled yet, becauſe he ſent for the Preacher whom he had diſturbed and perſecuted, a firſt, ſecond, and third time; and when he came to viſit him, he ſpake, <hi>You are the Perſon I have a great deſire to ſee; I think you, and the People whom I did perſecute, to be my Friends.</hi> He ſaid, he had been ſo vile a Wretch, and guilty of ſo many and great Sins, that he knew not by which he had moſt diſhonoured God: He had ſinned againſt Light, and was afraid God was not at peace with him; and that it had been better for him he had been a Toad than a Man. He was very importunate and urgent with the Miniſter to pray with him, and would have one ſtand at the Door in the mean time, that he might not be diſturbed by any Company, and that the Children ſhould be all put out. When the Miniſter ended his Prayer, he was very thankful to him, and reached out his hand to him, and held him long. He ſaid, he deſired to repent of all his Sins, was afraid, if God ſhould try him with longer Life, he ſhould return to his Filthineſs; but he looked for Death, which came and took him away a day or two after, but (as 'tis feared) unprepared and impenitent, upon ſuch Reaſons as I am loth to recite out of the Narrative, for their ill Example.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral remarkable Paſſages of God's Judgments upon him: (1.) He had one Child drowned, when he went to inform. (2.) Another choak'd at Nurſe, after he had gone on a while. (3.) Was croſſed in his Hopes of Gain by Informing. (4.) The deformed Conſumption of his Body, and being caſt off by his Friends. (5.) That ſo haughty a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould lie in a contemptible Place and State. (6.) That a third Child ſhould be taken by an Hoſt, to be kept in Charity. (7.) That the only
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102446:42"/>viſible Sign of Repentance ſhould be, to ſend for that Miniſter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his Prayers, rather than any other. (8.) That being a Priſoner at <hi>London,</hi> he ſhould, upon leave obtained, come to die in that Place and State, in the Face of his Companions, to convince and terrify them, and of them that he had perſecuted, to acknowledg his Fault.</p>
            <p>This Service proves (as the Devil's commonly doth) unprofitable; a Man may ſpend all in it, but is very uncertain of gaining any thing by it. It is rarely ſeen, that the Devil bears the Charges of his Servants, as others have found to their Coſt, in this preſent Life.</p>
            <p>One <hi>W. V.</hi> of <hi>M. H.</hi> hath been very poor ever ſince he took up the Calling, having ſcarce Bread to eat, and moſt remarkably viſited in his Family. His Brother Informer, <hi>J. H.</hi> about two Years after the Act againſt Conventicles came out, threw up the Trade as unprofitable; and ſince he became an Auditor of Mr. <hi>M. C.</hi> And one time this <hi>J. H.</hi> was informed of (by new Informers) as being preſent at a Meeting there, and was fined 5 <abbr>

               </abbr> He was a very ſerious and devout Hearer.</p>
            <p>After Sir <hi>John Hartopp</hi> was choſen Knight for <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> againſt a great Oppoſition, they who voted for him, were called <hi>Hartopians,</hi> and a Revenge was contrived upon the Proteſtant Diſſenters of <hi>H.</hi> To that end, one <hi>J— W</hi>— was made Conſtable, who indicted them all, not one ſpared, upon the Statute of Twenty Pounds <hi>per</hi> Month; which Fines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to ſo great a Sum, that underſtanding Perſons compute, if the whole Town of <hi>Harborough</hi> were to be ſold for ready Money, one Moiety of the Purchaſe would not diſcharge the Fines.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1679, this <hi>Jo. W</hi>— was thrown into <hi>Northampton</hi>-Goal, and tho none came in againſt him at the Aſſizes, the Judg ſaw ſufficient cauſe to continue him in Priſon; but upon great Sollicitation, he was bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till the Summer-Aſſizes. Within three Weeks after his coming home to <hi>Harborough,</hi> he took upon him to be Informer for the King. At the Summer-Aſſizes, he appeared to ſave his Bail, and to receive a Sentence of Condemnation (as it proved) from Judg <hi>Ellis,</hi> and Monday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was appointed for Execution, but it was by ſome means, not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known, procured he might be reſpited till Thurſday following, at which time there was a vaſt Confluence of People come together, from the Town and Country, a great way about, who knew him to be a grand Malefactor, to ſee Execution: But in the Nick of Time a Reprieve came down, (as ſome have ſaid, without the King's Knowledg.) So little abaſh'd was he at the Sentence of Death, that within an hour after he committed his common Sin in the Goal, as was reported upon good Credit.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102446:42"/>And on the expected Execution-Day, he made himſelf merry at the great Concourſe that came to the ſight of it. But after this he came home again, and made great Brags, that the Fanaticks ſhould repay his Charges, (of procuring Reprieves, and other Charges, which coſt ſome hundreds) reckoning his Moiety would come to Four Hundred Pounds. But as he could not leave the purſuit of his evil Deeds, ſo the Juſtice of God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him, and took him, (for Horſe-ſtealing, Coining, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance fell upon him at <hi>Wisbich,</hi> where he was, after many Eſcapes, once again condemned, and executed.</p>
            <p>There is a Succeſſor of his near the ſame place, and three of his perjured Hirelings, who take no warning as yet, and may in time become Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to them that take no warning: They can to appearance as freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear themſelves as they can ſpeak, being hardned in Sin, and ſenſleſs of Hell, and having Countenance, dare ſhew their Faces.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Eaſt-Salcomb</hi> in <hi>Devon,</hi> there dwelt one <hi>Joan Baſton,</hi> a Widow, aged, and blind, who for a ſuppoſed Conventicle kept at her Houſe, <hi>Anno</hi> 1673, was fined Twelve Pounds, and for non-payment of it, was threatned with a Goal. After ſome Weeks, the Officers came and broke open her Doors, and carried away much Goods above the value, terrifying her over and over with the Goal, and as was conceived, labouring to extort dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Words from her. They ſold as many Goods as were worth thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Pound, for Fifty Shillings; ſix Hogſheads, valued at Forty Sihllings, for nine Shillings; and Pewter, Feather-Beds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Twenty Shillings; and demanded of her Tenants her Rent, by which means ſhe ſuffered much.</p>
            <p>This is ſigned by <hi>J. B.</hi> and the Story related by another hand, and ſufficiently atteſted.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable having ſeized <hi>J. Baſton</hi>'s Goods, told me, <hi>We have been up and down about our Office, ſeizing the old Woman's Goods: This is the Fruit of your Rebellion. And as for Mr.</hi> Geo. Cawley, <hi>(the Preacher) he hath ſpoken Treaſon:</hi> To whom I replied, No, Sir, I hope not: <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and if he do not die, I will die for him.</hi> Sir — managed that falſe Accuſation againſt him, from which he was cleared at the Aſſizes.</p>
            <p>The Conſtable that falſly accuſed Mr. <hi>Coles</hi> of <hi>S.</hi> was taken ill at <hi>Exeter,</hi> and continued ill a Night and a Day: On Friday he endeavoured to go homewards with his Neighbours. In his Journey a wild Duck flew over his Head and backward and forward, at which his Horſe made a ſtop, and would not go forward. His Company demanded the reaſon of his Stand; he replied, he could not go further, <hi>I ſee a Fire befere me.</hi> A while after he went on, but the ſame Fire followed him to and fro all the way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102446:43"/>After his coming home, he fancied Thieves to be about his Houſe, attempting to break open the Doors; he heard ſuch a Sound and Noiſe, he ſent down his Servant-Maid to ſee, who found all faſt and quiet. She having lighted a Candle, he cried out, There are ſome coming up Stairs with great Lights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he continued till Lord's-Day at Night, and about two or three in the Morning died, ſenſleſs of his Condition. Thus it proved true, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſhould die, or he die for him; he died, but not for Mr. <hi>C.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Conſtable and Aſſiſtants, that ranſacked the old Widow's Houſe, brought forth the Pulpit into the High-Way, with half a Hogſhead of Sider, and therewith a Company of baſe Fellows drank Healths in the Pulpit, and when they had done, brake the Pulpit in pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edw. Warden</hi>'s Bible was diſtrained for his Fine of Three Shillings, when other Goods were refuſed.</p>
            <p>See the Piety of ſome of our Suppreſſors of Conventicles: Preachers are threatned with Hanging, and the Death of Traytors; they pull down a Pulpit, to ſet up Healthing in it; tear the Pulpit, diſtrain and ſell the Bible to chooſe, when they might have choice of other Goods.</p>

               <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1670, an Information was taken by <hi>J. T.</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and given by certain lewd Fellows, againſt ſome near <hi>Cruſe Morchard</hi> in <hi>Devon.</hi> The Informers were, <hi>John Partridg,</hi> that went always armed for fear of Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, <hi>Chr. Short,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Short:</hi> Theſe lay lurking about the Houſe of <hi>Tho. Melſhurſt,</hi> ſuſpecting a Meeting. Soon after they gave out, there had been Praying, or Preaching, or Expounding there, but which they could not tell, becauſe they were kept off from the Houſe by a great Bull-Dog, (which was ſhortly after poyſoned.) The Juſtice took a general information, (whether upon Oath or not, is not ſaid) and ſent out his Warrants to bring certain Perſons before him; one of which underſtanding the Informers were in the Houſe, deſired the Juſtice to call them, and asked the Informers, how they could tell there was Praying, or Preaching, or Expounding? and deſired to know which was done, ſeeing by their own Confeſſion they were kept off by the Dog. The Juſtice perceiving them to be at a loſs for an Anſwer, made Anſwer for them, <hi>They might know well enough which it was by the Tone;</hi> and upon that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed them, and among the reſt, one <hi>Nich. Melſhurſt,</hi> who was two Miles from the Place at the ſame time, as could be ſufficiently proved, paid his Fine. And <hi>Agnes Brook,</hi> Daughter of <hi>G. Br.</hi> of <hi>Morchard,</hi> was convicted and fined, who had been dead ſeveral Years before; I hope therefore ſhe paid not her Fine, nor was threatned, or ſent to Goal for Non-payment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:102446:43"/>
Now obſerve the Vices of theſe Perſons, and their Ends by divine Juſtice. <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>Sh.</hi> were ſtrongly ſuſpected for ſtealing ſix Oxen, four from <hi>G. Bodley</hi> of <hi>Morchard,</hi> and two from <hi>Hen. Lee</hi> of the ſame Pariſh: They were apprehended, and brought to their Trial, and <hi>Sh.</hi> was found guilty, and burnt in the hand, and ſince hath conſumed his Eſtate, and is fled the Country for fear of Arreſts. <hi>P.</hi> died not long after; and the other <hi>Sh.</hi> was taken in the Act of the unnatural Sin of Buggery, was found guilty, and died for it.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Helmere</hi> was ſuſpected to be a Conſpirator in the ſaid Information, and was apprehended as a Partner with the forenamed in ſtealing the Oxen, found guilty, and burnt in the hand. And ſince that, he and his Son were taken in the Act of Burglary, was ſent to Priſon, which he brake twice, and is fled, and not taken.</p>
            <p>Theſe Relations are ready to be atteſted by Perſons of unſuſpected Credit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aug.</hi> 26. 1676, four Informers had laid a Deſign to take Mr. <hi>J. Barret</hi> of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and his Hearers, who at that time had none to give intelligence from abroad of any coming to diſturb them. At the Town's-End the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers divided themſelves; ſome rode for a Warrant, others came to eſpy the Meeting. One of them walked again and again between two Stiles leading into the Yard, belonging to the Houſe where the Meeting was; and yet (as he confeſſed to the Owner of the Houſe ſome time after) he knew not what ailed him, but he had not power to go over the Stile, tho ſometimes he had his hand upon it; and tho the Houſe and Stacks about it, were ſhewn him before he came to Town, and had no reaſon to doubt but that was the Houſe, it ſtanding at a diſtance from any other Houſe, yet he turned to another Houſe, being neareſt to it, where a Woman being at home, was asked, <hi>Whether it was not ſuch a Man's Houſe? or whether the Meeting was not there?</hi> And ſhe ſaith ſtill, ſhe was ſo ſurprized with fear, that ſhe could make him no Anſwer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaid to the Woman, <hi>Canſt thou not ſpeak? art thou dumb? or art thou mad?</hi> This Account ſhe gave then, but it being ſo long ſince, ſhe may have forgotten; but being lately asked of it, ſhe ſaith, he ſaid, <hi>Art thou a Fool?</hi> But by this Conſuſion they were in, the People met, were gotten away before any Informers came in. The Informers haunted them ſeveral times after, and one time came in when there were but four beſides the Family, and the Children of the Town under ſixteen Years of Age. When they ſaw how they were croſſed ſeveral times, and Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> had charged him that came firſt, and his Companion, with breach of God's Law, not keeping the Sabbath-Day, but hindring others,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:102446:44"/>and put him in mind of a great Fit of Sickneſs he had, when he lay under very great Terrors, how often he had viſited him, and how welcome he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to him then, to viſit and pray with him. This Informer and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion ſeemed to relent. One of them was (not long after) put into the Goal for Deer-ſtealing.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>O. H.</hi> makes this Relation of a great Amazement and Diſturbance of Mind, upon ſome that were to take the Names of his Hearers.</p>

                  <hi>May</hi> 22. 1670. As I was riſing out of my Bed, my Servant came to me, and told me, there were two Men deſired to ſpeak with me; whoſe Buſineſs was to ask me, If I durſt adventure to preach in the Chappel, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> being abſent, and no notice being given to the People, many of whom would come, and be diſappointed? I utterly denied at firſt: They were loth to bring me into Trouble; yet if I was willing, the Chappel-Doors ſhould be opened, and the Bell rung. I conſidered of it, conſulted ſome Neighbours, begged direction of God, and about an hour after I conſented, upon theſe Conſiderations: They were my ancient People, I was forcibly thruſt from them, the Spirits of Men were much moderated; I knew the Sabbath would be profaned; it being <hi>Whit-Sunday,</hi> many Strangers walking abroad to ſee their Friends; Quakers twit us, that we will not venture upon Hazards: But above all, my Lord's Example, and the Neceſſity of Souls; and who knows what Good may be done?</p>
               <p>Upon this, about nine of the Clock, I went up, read, ſung, prayed, preached quietly, on <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Let them that love him be as the Sun, when he goeth forth in his Strength.</hi> About one in the Afternoon we met again, and about three of the Clock, Mr. <hi>St. Ell.</hi> brought <hi>Th. H.</hi> Church-Warden, and <hi>Sam. W.</hi> Overſeer, awing them with a Fine of Five Pounds if they refuſed. <hi>St. Ell.</hi> put in the Officers before him, who were exceedingly daunted. One of them was ſo awed and aſhamed, that he crept down into a Seat, and was ſo exceeding ſick, that he could not give account of one Perſon. The Informer went along among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, looked ſtreight at me, ſaid nothing, went down the Alley, and look'd upon the People as he went along. It was a Cauſe of Diſtraction to us; but I went on, and called to the People to look Proofs, which would be a Help to them againſt that Diſtraction. When they went out, <hi>St. E.</hi> ſent <hi>Th. H.</hi> again into the Chappel, to take Names: He again walked through the North Alley, ſtood at Seats ends, went out into the Chappel-Yard, where they conferred Notes, writ down Names: And tho the Chappel was full of their own Neighbours, yet they could not take ten Names, they were ſo confounded. The Munday ſeven-Night
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102446:44"/>following, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and Mr. <hi>C.</hi> two Juſtices, took my Buſineſs into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. The Informer <hi>St. E.</hi> ſtood there, examining the Officers by Interrogations: <hi>Did not you ſee ſuch and ſuch there?</hi> And ſo they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted ten Names of many Hundreds that were preſent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 13. 1670, <hi>J. M.</hi> Conſtable, <hi>Th. H. S. W.</hi> came to make diſtreſs of my Goods, with three Bearer; to carry them away. The Conſtable took hold of the Bed whereon I lay, put off his Hat, ſaying, <hi>I ſeize upon this Bed for his Majeſty's uſe.</hi> I told them, It was enough for them to mark them, and leave them, till they had Chapmen to buy them: They ſaid, the Informer would buy them. So they took Bed, Bedding, Tables, Chairs, Cheſts, Books, to the value of Feurteen Pounds, for Ten Pounds. My Wife deſired them to take Chairs, rather than our Meal-Cheſt; but they laid a Curtain upon the Floor, and poured out the Meal upon it, and took away our Cheſt. They carried the Goods into an Alehouſe, and drank upon them, got Prizers, who prized them at 10 <abbr>

They cauſed the Bell-man to cry the Goods in <hi>Hallifax, Auguſt</hi> 13. but could ſell none of them. The Juſtices bad the Officers to take them themſelves. They anſwered, they had Goods enough. The Conſtable grew weary of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, delivered all to the Hands of the ſucceeding Conſtable.<note place="margin">Nonconformiſts Goods a dead Commodity; Who paid for the Feaſt then?</note> The Houſe where they were laid up grew weary of them, and deſired the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to find a Room for them, or they would caſt them out: They got leave to ſet them in a Barn in <hi>Coley-Hall. June</hi> 6. 1671. One <hi>Robert Reyner</hi> of <hi>Wakefield,</hi> brought a Cart and five Horſes to fetch them away, — When they laid a Chair in the Cart, one ſaid, <hi>Where's</hi> Heywood<hi>'s God now, that he uſed to pray to?</hi> They remained ſtill at <hi>Wakefield, Auguſt</hi> 15. 1680.</p>

            <p>In <hi>December</hi> 1668, Mr. <hi>John Shuttlewood,</hi> ſometimes Miniſter of <hi>R.</hi> in the County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> was taken with many others, ſinging a Pſalm by <hi>M. B.</hi> and thirty or forty Horſemen with Swords drawn and Piſtols cock'd, ſeveral of both Sexes were beaten and driven into the Field, and diſmiſſed upon promiſe of appearing next day before ſome Juſtice of Peace; Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> was examined by Juſtice <hi>S.</hi> when he had been at his Pariſh Church to hear Divine Service? Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> anſwered, he knew none charged him for Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: the Juſtice asked him, if he would promiſe to go the next Sunday? Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> anſwered, he did not know how Divine Providence might diſpoſe of him before that time; upon this the Juſtice made him his <hi>Mittimus</hi> for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102446:45"/>a Breach of the 35 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and delivered him to the Cuſtody of one <hi>Charles Gibbons,</hi> a Quarter-Maſter in a Troop of the Trained Bands, to convey him to <hi>Lieceſter</hi> Goal.</p>
            <p>It being too late that Night, they reſted where they were, and Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> craving a Bleſſing upon their Meat, <hi>Gibbons</hi> comes into the Room, and ſwore a bloody Oath, and ſaid, <hi>What, are you a preaching?</hi> Soon after a Neighbour Gentleman came, and made requeſt, that Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> and the reſt of the Priſoners might go that Night to their own Houſes, and offered a Bond of a thouſand Pounds for their Appearance; the Gentleman preſſing hard for that Night's Liberty. <hi>Gibbons</hi> girt his Sword about him, and ſwore deſperately, that ſince he loved them ſo well, he ſhould go with them, and continued ſwearing all the Night, that in caſe he ſtirr'd, (to uſe his own Phraſe) he would make the Sun ſhine through him. Next Morning <hi>Gibbons</hi> ſent the Priſoners away with ſome Souldiers, and ſtaid himſelf with the Gentleman; and glad they were, they were going to Priſon, as being in worſe than Priſon till they were there. Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> and the other continued in Priſon till the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> and were then diſmiſt.</p>

Indeed be could not ſwear a Conventicle, for as the laſt Sentence went out of the Preacher's Mouth, he came to the Window and ſwore a dreadful Oath.</note> He could not ſwear there was a Conventicle, whereupon the Juſtice was about to diſmiſs them: but a Lawyer preſent told him, he might convict them upon notorious Evidence, which he did, and ſent War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to diſtrain upon Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> for 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> and 20 <abbr>

               </abbr> a piece on others; Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> conveyed away his Cattel, but the reſt paid. <hi>Anno</hi> 1672, while Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> had the King's Licence, <hi>Gibbons</hi> came upon him, and took him and the Maſter of the Houſe, and brought them before Capt. <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>L.</hi> who then refuſed to act, but afterwards did ſend out his Warrants to diſtrain 20 <abbr>

               </abbr> on the Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but both eſcaped, tho not without Damages: but great Fines were laid upon the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102446:45"/>Hearers. In the end of <hi>February,</hi> 74, <hi>Gibbons</hi> came with armed Men to Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Lubnam, Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> roaring into the Congregation after his wonted manner, and took ſeveral Names, appointing Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> and them to meet him next day, at an Alehouſe in <hi>Shoaresby,</hi> to appear before his Great Maſter, Col. <hi>F.</hi> who was wont to furniſh him with Warrants before-hand. But the Colonel's Son, a Son of his old Age, dying that morning, (who fell ſick, as it is ſaid, that Day his Father gave his Warrants to break up that Meeting.) They all appeared according to promiſe, and were diſmiſs'd, upon promiſe to appear upon lawful Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Inſtead of ſuch a Summons, <hi>Gibbons</hi> got a Warrant of Sir <hi>Th. B.</hi> (not long after deceaſed) to diſtrain upon Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi> for forty Pounds: And the Officers took away ſeven Milch-Cows of Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi>'s, and offered them to Sale; and the beſt Chapman that came, was <hi>D. S.</hi> of <hi>M.</hi> who paid ſeven Pounds for them, and Six-pence Earneſt, (without the privity of Mr. <hi>Sh.</hi>) which was paid to the Officers, who paid it to the Juſtices, who gave Receipts for the Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. S.</hi> branded four of the Cows, and joiſted them in the Grounds of one <hi>J. W.</hi> of <hi>Langton. Gibbons,</hi> and his great Companion <hi>Percy,</hi> hearing of the Cows, go to the Conſtable, who had a Warrant to diſtrain upon the ſaid <hi>Jo. Wilſon</hi> for 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 15 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> for being at the ſame Meeting; <hi>Gibbons</hi> and <hi>Percy</hi> got the Warrant out of the Conſtable's hands, pretending to take ſomething out of it, but it was to put more in, <hi>viz.</hi> to empower <hi>Percy</hi> to diſtrain the four Cows. And ſo both went into the Ground, and drave the Cows, impounded them about an Hour, and then took them out, and drave them to <hi>Gilmorton,</hi> where they were met by another of their Companions, one <hi>Savage,</hi> and ſet a Guard upon the Cows. <hi>D. S.</hi> hearing theſe things, went to Capt. <hi>C.</hi> for a Warrant, to fetch <hi>Gibbons</hi> before him upon ſuſpicion of Felony; but the Juſſice refuſed to give him his Warrant except he would lay flat Felony to their charge, which <hi>D. S.</hi> could not do, becauſe they impounded them firſt. He goes to <hi>Gibbons,</hi> to know by what Authority he took away the Cows, demanded the Cows, which they refuſed to do, <hi>Gibbons</hi> telling him, he ſhould not have a Tail of them to wipe his Mouth with. He went to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> Under-Sheriff, for a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevin,</hi> which he told him he could not grant, becauſe it was againſt the King.</p>
            <p>One of the Perſons diſtrained upon, came to pay 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 15 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; <hi>Gibbons</hi> caught up the Money, and gave it to his Partner <hi>Percy,</hi> and ſaid, he ſhould be Conſtable; and away they went with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>D. S.</hi> heard, that <hi>Gibbons</hi> had conveyed away the four Cows in the Night, after which he never heard of them more, and ſent for a Writ for him; but when the Bayliffs came to arreſt <hi>Gibbons,</hi> they found he was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:102446:46"/>protected by the above-ſaid Col. <hi>F.</hi> a Parliament-Man, (and in the Liſt of Penſioners) as one of his Servants.</p>
            <p>But the Juſtice and Vengeance of God took him out of that Sanctuary; for being at <hi>Lutterworth,</hi> in <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1675, very full of Drink, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that day given out many threatning Speeches againſt ſeveral Diſſenters, he would not be perſuaded to ſtay all Night, tho it was late, about nine in the Night, but would go home: But when he had gone about half a Mile towards home, he fell into a Ditch, through which a little Water runs, and falling aſleep (as we muſt ſuppoſe) he damm'd up that little Iſſue of Water by which he was found drowned next Morning by a Milk-Maid, in a very remarkable manner; for all his Body was above Water, except his Neck and Face: neither was the Water high enough, when it was damm'd up, to cover all his Face, for ſome part of his Noſe and Forehead were ſeen above Water.</p>
            <p>A Conforming Miniſter, and a worthy Man, ſince deceaſed, who knew him well, entred this following Remark in <hi>Beard</hi>'s Theatre of Judgments: <q>
                  <hi>Charles Gibbons,</hi> a notorious Swearer and Drunkard, having been at <hi>Lutterworth</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> being full of Drink, and it being late at Night, was diſſuaded from going home, which was at <hi>Kimcot,</hi> two Miles off, ſwore he would go home in ſpight of all the Devils in Hell; but he was found dead next morning in a ſhallow Run of Water, which did not cover his Body, betwixt <hi>Lutterworth</hi> and <hi>Miſterton.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One of <hi>Gibbons</hi>'s Companions, that had been drinking with him that Evening, and parted with him when he went out of Town, was ſadly affrighted in his going home to his own Houſe in <hi>Lutterworth,</hi> with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a black Sow, which he ſaid, when he heard next Morning that <hi>Gibbons</hi> was dead, was the Devil going to drown <hi>Gibbons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Gibbons</hi> was found, he had not one Penny in his Purſe, and his Goods were valued at Two Shillings and Six-Pence. Here's one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more of outragious Profaneneſs, a miſerable ſudden Death, and deep Poverty. Who ever read or heard of an Informer, bleſt in Body or Goods?</p>
            <p>And the Fortune of his Companion <hi>Percy</hi> ran very low; for all he could muſter up to pay the Charges of <hi>D. S.</hi>'s Suit, which was 9 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> 10 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> came but to ſix Pound, made off the little Goods he had, fled his Country, became a Driver of Beaſts about <hi>Iſlington,</hi> afterwards a Foot-Souldier, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a Beggar, and ſo he died, as is commonly ſaid.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October,</hi> 1681, <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Holdſworth,</hi> both Inhabitants of <hi>Deeping</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> (<hi>Watſon</hi> was a very witty; cloſe, cunning Fellow; <hi>Holdſworth</hi> was a heavy, clumſy, poor Fellow; the one fitted to direct,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102446:46"/>the other to follow) came to <hi>Okeham</hi> in <hi>Rutland,</hi> (in hopes of good Markets, by the Sale of Modeſty, Truth, and their precious Souls, and other Mens Goods) there a Nonconformiſt Preacher and his Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on met out of Church-time: The Preacher kept up in an upper Room, and the Doors of the Houſe were lock'd, ſo that the Informers could only ſometimes hear a Voice indiſtinctly, but they heard enough for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: They went and ſwore againſt the Preacher, (whoſe Name they had learned ſince their coming to Town) that there was an unlawful Meeting in his Houſe. Upon which a Warrant was iſſued out for Twenty Pounds upon him; and yet they named no Preacher, nor Hearers.</p>
            <p>They informed of a Meeting of Quakers, and ſwore there were ten Perſons at it, and particularly one <hi>Bowman,</hi> who was not there, nor had been there in half a Year before.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fellows, in their return home, were overtaken by a ſober Perſon, who rode about two Miles with them, and, to their great vexation, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed of the Calling of Informers, and the untimely Ends of ſeveral of them, and therefore warn'd them often and earneſtly to take head: But <hi>VVatſon</hi> ſaid, The Diſſenters were Hell-born Rogues, and an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers Trade was lawful.</p>
            <p>About <hi>February</hi> following (laſt paſt) <hi>VVatſon</hi> fell ill, his Tongue was black and ſwelled, ſome while before he died, and led his Companion the way into the other World, where there is not as much as a Preacher's Voice to be heard. Within a Week after <hi>Holdſworth</hi> followed him, crying out in his Sickneſs, <hi>The Devil, the Devil; he will fetch me, do not you ſee him?</hi> and wiſning he had not engaged in that Way.</p>
            <p>Theſe miſerable Wretches were poor and broken Men before they took this Trade, were defeated of the Fines levied upon their Informations, in the Parts where they lived, and died extreme poor.</p>
            <p>Some Souldiers came one Lord's-Day, in <hi>April</hi> laſt, 1682, Low-Sunday, as it is remembred, to break up a Meeting, and to take Mr. <hi>Browning</hi> of <hi>R.</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire.</hi> The Conſtable admoniſhed them to be well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed what they did: <hi>For</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>when Sir — was alive, he eagerly proſecuted theſe Meetings, and engaged eight Souldiers of the County-Troop therein, whereof my ſelf was one. Sir — himſelf is dead,</hi> (it is ſaid, he died not long after) <hi>ſix of the eight Souldiers are dead; ſome of them were hanged, and ſome of them broke their Necks; and I my ſelf fell off my Horſe, and broke my Neck in the Act of Proſecuting them, and it coſt me thirty Shillings to be cured and recovered. It hath given me ſuch warning, that for my part I am reſolved I will never meddle with them more.</hi> He told this
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:102446:47"/>Story to them all at ſeveral times that day. This Story is related by others with ſome conſiderable Circumſtances; but this being the more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Relation, I give it almoſt in the very ſame Words, in which it was ſent from a good and reputable hand to a Friend.</p>
            <p>Several Juſtices of Peace were in a great Heat that day in the purſuit of the Preacher, and the Meeting; but the Birds were flown, before they could caſt their Net, and ſo eſcaped.</p>
            <p>I do not hear that this Conſiable, for all his Conviction, is at any time a Hearer at that Meeting. It is remarkable, how ſuch Perſons may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and how readily the Conſcience, a little awakened, makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Divine Providences to be Acts of Judgment, and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions to them.</p>
            <p>From the ſame hand I am aſſured of another Example: Since that, <hi>W. H.</hi> one of the Church-wardens of the ſame Pariſh and one of the moſt imbittered Enemies of the Meetings, who had often Quarrels with ſome of his near Relations about them, and eſpecially the Night before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who was ſuddenly ſtruck dead in his own Yard, and never ſpoke, nor breathed one Breath after he was taken with it: As he had no notice of its Arreſt, till it came; ſo he gave no notice of his being to die, to any other. Surely the Conſtable muſt needs be confirmed in his Reſolutions againſt Acting, by this ſudden Death. Some threatning Words againſt the Barn, the common Name of Meetings, ſpoken by him, are by ſome remembred; but general Words are moſt ſparing, and I will content my ſelf with them.</p>
            <p>That it may not be thought that our Nonconformiſt Brethren do ſtretch and enlarge ſmall and ordinary Occurrences, and Acts of Divine Providence, I will ſhew you what Caution and Modeſty is to be ſeen in their Accounts of Paſſages. One writes thus, who is known to have ſuffered Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to wade through many Troubles, and is at this time under a moſt ſevere and watchful Eye: <hi>As to my ſelf, I have been ſo careleſs in keeping any exact Account of what I have met with, that I cannot do it: In the general, I can only ſay this, That in all I have met with, God bath ſo dealt with me, that I have ſuffered very little.</hi> Another to his Friend: <hi>I could have ſent you ſome other Accounts, but that I and others are afraid to grate too much upon ſome Perſons.</hi> And another to his enquiring Friend, with a like Modeſty: <hi>Thus much I know in the general, that ſeveral foul Perjuries have Informers in this County been guilty of, for which ſome of them have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and convicted, and afterwards fled and abſconded, to eſcape Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. — And very many of the Informers and Perſecutors, have been Perſons
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:102446:47"/>of moſt profligate Lives. — And the Hand of God hath moſt eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared againſt ſome of them, by untimely Deaths, by the Hand of God remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably ſtretched forth againſt them, as I have been certainly informed, by Perſons of undoubted Credit; but in regard I cannot give an exact and particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all Circumſtances, I am conſtrained to paſs by theſe Things in ſilence, than to wrong the Account by any Miſtakes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot paſs over one Obſervation within mine own view. In the Country where I live, the Informers are a new Set of Men; ſome that were Informers in former Years are yet alive, but deſiſt and refuſe to inform, either upon Conviction of Conſcience, Fear of Evil, Obſervation of the ſhort, ſhameful, and miſerable Ends of others, or other ſtrong Reſtraints upon them. I am credibly informed of one, whoſe Name and Perſon I know, that hath gone to a Nonconformiſt Preacher, with theſe or the like Words: <hi>Sir, I have done you Wrong, and brought Trouble upon you; I pray forgive me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But moſt free and full, truly pious and penitent, is this Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which was ſent by one that had been an Informer, to a moleſted Diſſenter, faithfully tranſcribed by me in the Informer's own Words.</p>

                  <p>I <hi>Acknowledg mine Error, and that I did fooliſhly in coming to your Houſe, and in diſturbing the Company which were met there, and in bringing you and them on the Stage, and into a ſuffering Condition; which hath ſeveral times troubled me very much, and at this time lies heavy upon me, becauſe I am not in a Condition to return you and your Friends, what is out of your and their Pockets: But if ever it ſhall pleaſe God to make me in a Condition able thereto, I do intend, to the beſt of my Power, to bear your and your Friends Disburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which you and your Friends were put to by my occaſion, by returning to you and them, ſome of what you and they have been forced to pay by my means. And in the mean time, I do earneſtly deſire you, and your Friends which have been Sufferers with you, to forgive me the Wrong which I have done to every one of you. I do deſire you, and all that were Partakers with you in your Sufferings, to be earneſt with God in your Prayers for me, not once, but often, to deſire the Lord to forgive me the Sin which I committed againſt him, in what I did againſt you, and them which were met at your Houſe, when I diſturbed Mr.</hi> King <hi>in his Exerciſe.

            <p>I ſhall propoſe ſome other Objects of God's Diſpleaſure, tho not of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers, but of ſuch as have opened their Mouths in Menaces againſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that have declared a Spirit of Diſobedience againſt God, and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt his Servants.</p>
            <p>The great Uſe that ſome make of the Laws is, to be Inſtruments of their Diſaffection to, and Revenge upon ſuch as they hate, not knowing how to come at them by any other Law, being inculpable as to other Crimes and Miſdemeanors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 13. 1660. One <hi>H. H.</hi> of <hi>T. Ev.</hi> in the C. of <hi>W.</hi> was very active in getting a Warrant againſt Mr. <hi>P.</hi> Miniſter of that Place, and ſeveral other Miniſters, for not reading Common-Prayer, (while there was an Indulgence in that Point.) He left Order with his Uncle <hi>A. H.</hi> Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if any ſuch Warrant came in his abſence to him, he ſhould ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily execute it: He went that day to <hi>G.</hi> a Neighbour-Village, and being drunk with one <hi>T.

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:102446:48"/>
This Judgment of God might have befallen him for him Drunkenneſs, or he might have eſcaped it, as many Drunkards do; but his Enmity againſt his Miniſter, known to be a worthy good Man, was an Accumulation of his Sins, and a refuſing to be taught and reformed by him. What cared ſuch Perſons for the Common-Prayer, as it was the Form of Service paid to God? If it had been from Zeal to that, he would have abſtained from his ſcandalous Sins.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Lewis Facy</hi> Miniſter, impriſoned by a <hi>Capias</hi> in <hi>Bodmyn</hi> Goal in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> was no ſooner entred, but was railed at, by a violent ſpirited Woman in the Priſon: He mildly deſired her to forbear, kept himſelf retired, and while he <hi>was at Prayer,</hi> ſhe came and railed at him, at his Chamber-door, at which ſhe was taken with a Numbneſs (a Palſy) ſo that ſhe could not ſpeak nor help her ſelf.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> of <hi>Ottery</hi> St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> was by the contrivance of a High Conſtable, apprehended by a Petty Conſtable, (lodged in the High Conſtable's Houſe to that purpoſe) as he was going to a Funeral,<note place="margin">The famous Acts of this Juſtice <hi>B.</hi> may be read in a printed Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from <hi>Devon.</hi>
               </note> by a Warrant from one Juſtice <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> and put under Guard, and made to pay his Guard, till they carried him to Goal for ſix Months, for living within five Miles of this Pariſh. The Head Conſtable goes out of the way, conveying himſelf to <hi>Exton,</hi> before Mr. <hi>Collins</hi> was taken. But as near as can be computed the High Conſtable was taken ill at <hi>Exton,</hi> in the very hour in which the Petty Conſtable ſerved his Warrant on Mr. <hi>Collins,</hi> and was carried home, the next day died.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Tregoſſe</hi> relates this following Providence of God, in Mercy and Judgment. In the Lent Aſſize, at <hi>Exon,</hi> 1670, his Trial was put off, the Deputy-Mayor of <hi>Torrington</hi> attending, who was the grand Enemy. At the next Aſſizes, the ſaid <hi>G. S.</hi> Deputy-Mayor, could not attend, and thereby Mr. <hi>Treg.</hi> was acquitted by the Jury. But what hindred or kept his Adverſary at home? He had in a drunken Voyage, fallen from his Horſe, by which his Shoulder Bone was diſlocated, and he became unable to dreſs or undreſs himſelf, and ſo like to continue to his Death: His Wife, a violent Woman, died of a Tympany (a fearful Spectacle) the Lord's-day Night, after Mr. <hi>T.</hi> had preached at <hi>Torrington.</hi> One <hi>Denis,</hi> Brother-in-law to <hi>Smith,</hi> who rejoyced at the breaking up of the Conventicle, which he ſaid did him more good, than all his Loſſes did ſadden him; this poor Wretch (ſaid he) did hang himſelf in his Study, and his Eſtate forfeited to the Town; this great Judgment befel his Wife, to have her Husband hang himſelf, and his Eſtate forfeited, who belched out theſe Words upon Mr. <hi>Treg. Hang the Rogue, bang him at the Sign-poſt, or next Tree, and never ſend him to</hi> Exon.</p>
            <p>Before ever I ſaw the Life of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Tregoſſe</hi> I received the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Story related in it, from an indifferent hand reſident in thoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:102446:49"/>Parts; and becauſe it is expoſed in Print already, I ſhall be the more bold to tranſcribe it: Mr. <hi>T. Ro.</hi> a Juſtice of Peace had committed Mr. <hi>Tr.</hi> to Priſon for three Months; he had not come home out of Priſon four days before Mr. <hi>Rob.</hi> gave out, that he would ſpeedily ſend him back again to the Place from whence he came. He deſigned to go to Market to get another Juſtice of Peace to joyn with him; but before his going thither, he went according to his uſual cuſtom, to viſit a Tenant's Wife, and in his return, was ſet upon by his own Bull, which never ran at any one before, which goared him ſo, that he died of his Wounds.</p>
            <p>A Perſon of Quality too violently acted, and influenced by ſome of high Dignity, ſet himſelf to proſecute the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> that lived within his reach; and one time making a viſit to a great Peer, did make too much ſport with his Imployment, ſaying, He had been perſecuting the Godly Party; and among other Stories, repreſenting them very odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, he told this Paſſage, full of Blaſphemy (and I doubt not as full of Falſhood in thoſe who told it him) in a Prayer, ſpeaking to the Divine Majeſty; <hi>Thou art like</hi> George <hi>on Horſe-back, thou ſeemeſt to come, but doſt not come.</hi> If it had been true and certain ſuch Language had been uſed, certainly it ſhould not have been repeated with Pleaſure. His Coach-man did not make Expedition in bring his Coach to him: then ſaid he, <hi>My Coach-man is like</hi> George <hi>on Horſe-back, he ſeems to come, but doth not come.</hi> Thus making Sport; but in his return home, he was taken ſo ill, that he betook himſelf to his Chamber and in his Bed, and all the Prayers and Tears of his Friends could not prolong his Days, Death made ſpeed and would not tarry.</p>
            <p>Now it is time to bring home theſe Examples and preſent them to the view, and lay them not at the Doors, but before the Hearts and Conſciences of three ſorts of Perſons, at this time too deeply, if not too heartily engaged in the Suppreſſion of <hi>Nonconforming Proteſtants.</hi>

               <hi>Noble and worſhipful Gentlemen,</hi> I made bold in a former Plea, to addreſs to you on the behalf of my Reverend Brethren, ſo I call them, becauſe Chriſtians, and becauſe they are Proteſtants and Divines of Age and Learning: I account their Sufferings to be a great breach upon our
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:102446:50"/>Proteſtant Body, a weakening of our Strength, a Blot upon our profeſſed Chriſtianity, no Service to the King or Church, but a rejoycing and a Service to their and our profeſſed Enemies: it can be for no Man's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, Profit, or Honour to trouble the Servants of Chriſt, and to provoke his Wrath, which if it be kindled but a little — <hi>Bleſſed are all they who put their truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may better ſpeak in the Cauſe of others, than in mine own; and when I plead for them, I really believe, I offer you a Service that ſhould not be deſpiſed, but favourably conſtrued, and kindly taken; for I do warn you to have nothing to do with the Ruine of juſt, good, peaceable, holy, learned Men and Chriſtians, and the King's good Subjects, yea, and ſome of your beſt Friends; for I do believe, they make many Prayers to God for you, to turn your Hearts, to ſave your Souls; and their Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for you, are as one piece of Defence between you and harm. If theſe are my Miſtakes, I am miſtaken; and if I am altogether miſtaken, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you pardon the Miſtake, and accept the Affection, Reſpect, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Good-will I bear you; for I would ſerve you without a Miſtake if I could. But verily, I think, I am pretty right in my Judgment of this Caſe; and have the concurrent ſenſe of ſome of them, or of their Relations, who have been active in the ſame way in which you now appear.</p>
            <p>You are not all of a Mind and Temper; you act from various Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Habits of Mind; and theſe are as various, as thoſe obſerved by that antient Chriſtian-<hi>Cicero, Lactantius,</hi> of the Proſecutors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. <hi>Acceptâ enim Poteſtate pro ſuis moribus quiſ<expan>

            <p>You ſay we have a Law, and according to that the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> ought to ſuffer, and you are impowered to execute the Laws indifferently.</p>

This was the ſtrained Pretence of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be ſo urgent with <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> to crucify our Saviour; <hi>John</hi> 19.7. <hi>We have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dy:</hi> Whereas he ought not to have been accounted a Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in ſaying, He was the Son of God, for he was ſo; and if he had been a Blaſpemer, by which of their Laws did they cry, <hi>Crucify, crucify him?</hi> Give me leave I beſeeeh you to ſpeak freely. I have not in all my Narratives touch'd upon any that I know now to have his Sword drawn in this freſh Aſſault; but have related things paſt to be your Admonitions and Examples, that I may not provoke, but profit you.</p>
            <p>I grant you have a Law, and I believe many of you do wiſh there were no ſuch Law, and many are weary and cautious, ſparing and fair in the Execution of it. But I beſeech you once again to keep to the Scope of the Law, and to the Law it ſelf, as relating to the Scope, and there will be no need of Tumults to guard any of your Perſons to find out and diſperſe the Meetings, nor ſuch fear of you from the Nonconformiſts. That Preaching and Praying which contains matter of Sedition, Rebellion and Inſurrection, and is expreſly of that nature without forced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Conſtruction, or perverted illogical Inferences, are the only Exerciſes under the name of <hi>Religious Exerciſes,</hi> which you can juſtly puniſh. Reading Scripture, ſinging Pſalms are Religious Exerciſes, and the matter of them undoubtedly godly. Preaching and Praying are as undoubtedly God's Ordinances, as the Scripture is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Words. It is as manifeſt Impiety to forbid theſe, any of theſe, or all of them in one Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, as it would be to obliterate any part of Holy Writ, or to cancel any Divine Law. It is Impiety, and not to be ſuppoſed that any Chriſtian Legiſlators ſhould make a Law to prohibit any Religious Duty or Exerciſe in it ſelf conſidered; and if any of you think you may puniſh Preachers or Hearers, for ſuch undoubted Religious Exerciſes, you ſin againſt God; and all the Laws in the World cannot juſtify your ſo doing, for no Law of Man can defend any Man in ſinning againſt the Law of God.</p>
            <p>It is true that the Preface of a Law is not a Law, and the Scope of the Law is not the Law; but as the Scope of the Law expreſſed in the Preface, was the Reaſon and Intention of the Law-maker; and all the general Words in the Law, were formed with reference to the Scope (or elſe they were not made as rational Means conducing to its Ends, no more than it would be to forbid ſpeaking, that there might be no ſwearing). Any Exerciſe of Religion, that tends to Sedition; Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and to move Inſurrection, is ſo far puniſhable, as it is abuſed and perverted to that unſufferable End; or elſe you puniſh Religious Duties abſolutely taken, becauſe by ſuch Numbers, or by Perſons above ſixteen Years of Age, in ſuch Numbers; and then you'l ſay, it is not religious
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:102446:51"/>Duties that is puniſhed, but the prohibited number, of above four beſides the Family. But then again, the number abſolutely taken doth not make a Crime, or ſhould not, but as it is ſuppoſed to ſoment Sedition. For, why ſhall it be unlawful for twenty, forty, or a hundred of divers Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to meet in one Place for Religious Exerciſes, any more than for ſome noble and great Family, of ſome one Noble-Man or Gentleman, or Board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, which hath ſo many Perſons in it, to meet together in one Hoom for Religious Duties?</p>
            <p>Beſides this, it is clear that the Clauſes in the Act againſt Conventicles, refers to Such an Aſſembly as is prohibited in the beginning of the Act: for theſe words, <hi>Such Offender, ſo convicted, ſuch Offence, like Offence, ſuch Meeting, ſuch Conventicle,</hi> is repeated twelve or thirteen times in the body of the Act. Now <hi>ſuch</hi> relates to a Meeting before deſcribed and forbidden; <hi>Such</hi> Meeting we find in the beginning of it. The Act is for <hi>providing further and more ſpeedy Remedies againſt growing and dangerous Practiſes of ſeditious Sectaries, and other diſloyal Perſons, who under pretence of tender Conſciences, have, or may at their Meetings contrive Infurrections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be it enacted. <hi>&amp;c. That if any Perſon of the Age of ſixteen Years, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being a Subject of this Realm — ſhall be preſent at any Aſſembly, Conventicle or Meeting</hi> (mark the words) <hi>[under colour or pretence] of any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Religion, in other manner than according to the Liturgy, and Practice of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in any place within the Kingdom of</hi> England, Dom. W. <hi>or</hi> T. <hi>of</hi> B. <hi>upon</hi> T. <hi>at which Conventicle there ſhall be five Perſons or more, over and beſides thoſe of the ſame Houſhould; or if it be in a Houſe, Field, or place where is no Family inhabiting, Then where any five Pirſons or more aſſembled as aforeſaid; It ſhall and may be lawful to and for any one or more Juſtices of Peace upon Proof of ſuch Offence—. Which Proof is either by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Party, or Oath of two Witneſſes — or notorious Evidence and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the Fact, to make Record,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Will you cut off the Act from the Preface? or have you no regard to the words of the Act, <hi>under colour or pretence of any</hi> Exerciſe of Religion? then you take no notice of the Diſcription of the Perſons who make up an unlawful Aſſembly or Conventicle. Here are three things to make a Conventicle. 1. The Perſons, Number and Age, called <hi>ſeditious Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>diſloyal Perſons.</hi> 2. An Aſſembly of above four of theſe, under colour and pretence of any Exerciſe of Religion, over and above the Family.</p>
            <p>Where obſerve, 1. What is implied or ſuſpected, (nay, it muſt be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe it muſt be proved by Witneſſes, or Confeſſion of the Party,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102446:51"/>or notorious Evidence or Circumſtances of the Fact) that ſome ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance is carrying on, <hi>under colour or pretence of any Exerciſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is ſaid, <hi>any Exerciſe of Religion,</hi> that is, as I conceive any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Duty, as reading a Chapter, ſinging Pſalms, as well as Preaching, Praying, adminiſtring Sacraments, or Diſcipline: whereby it is clear, the Law forbids not any Exerciſe, no not preaching in it ſelf, but <hi>the colour and pretence</hi> of it, in clear and expreſs words.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In other manner than according to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of</hi> England. The meaning of which is ambiguous, and commonly interpreted, if any Exerciſe of Religion be without the Liturgy, and then it is ambiguous, to ſay, <hi>in other manner than,</hi> &amp;c. when the meaning is, without the Liturgy. The Nonconformiſts have no other manner of Reading, Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than is uſual in the Practice of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> nor other manner of Preaching, than what is practiſed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is the meeting of ſuch ill Perſons, that abuſe Religion as a colour and pretence, to conceal deſperate and pernitious Practices in any other manner than according to the Liturgy. And <hi>ſuch Perſons, ſuch Offences, ſuch Meetings ſo convicted,</hi> are ſubject to ſuch Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties.</p>
            <p>Now then Gentlemen, keep to the Laws, and ſpare none, But then conſider; why have any acted ſo, as to make no difference between ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Sectaries and diſloyal, and peaceable loyal Perſons? why have they not diſtinguiſhed, as the Act doth, between any ſubſtantial, innocent Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the colour or pretence of it? but taking it in the lump, it hath been puniſhed, without inquiry after the Leaven of Sedition that leavened the Lump.</p>
            <p>I do heartily wiſh this may fall into the Hands, and upon the Heart of that Miniſter of Juſſice, who drawing out Evidence from an impudent Informer, to prove an Information, asked him this Queſtion, <hi>Was there Preaching there?</hi> If the Informer could have truly ſworn, that there was Preaching there; let the Examiner, as one that ſhall be judged in the great day, think before-hand, how Preaching (not tainted with Sedition, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to any Evil to the State) deſerved to come in as a Crime, or the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher puniſhable for it. Certainly Preaching ſhould be judged a Duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageable and not puniſhable in a Chriſtian Judicature. It ſhould be harſh to a Chriſtian Ear, to hear Preaching, <hi>an Ordinance of God, and the Power of God to Salvation,</hi> enquired after as a Crime! I wiſh God may not lay it to any Magiſtrate's Charge, You have fined and impriſoned my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, for preaching and hearing my Word; and I wiſh that every ſuch one may judg himſelf for it, and repent before he go to God's Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:102446:52"/>
Why have any puniſhed the ſinging of a Pſalm in a Meeting, which was in the Metre and Tune practiſed by the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Why, when the Informer being preſent, and making the fifth Man, have the reſt ſuffered as a Conventicle, there being but four above the Family, and the Informer the fifth?</p>
            <p>Is there no way to execute a Law, but by a violation of the Law? What Law is there for tearing up Free-Holds, pulling down Houſes, tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Seats? Which looks liker a Rout or Riot? a Company of Boys and rude Fellows, ſome with Swords, and others with Staves and Clubs about the Streets, to break up Meetings of Men without Arms, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children? What Law is there for executing Warrants on the Lord's-Day? There is one againſt it. What Law is there for Juſtices to give out Warrants, that lie dormant in Officers hands, empowering them to break up Meetings that are foreſeen, or foretold to be? What Law requires a Juſtice to be an Informer? to break open Doors at unſeaſonable Hours, to fright Women with Child, and others into Fits, when there is not ſo much as any notorious Evidence or Circumſtance, much leſs Oath of any Witneſs or Witneſſes?</p>
            <p>Now let us come to the Proof; What is a notorious Evidence or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Fact? Of what Fact? Of any Religious Exerciſe without the Liturgy; that's the Fact: Now what is the notorious Evidence of it? Not a Tone, nor a Voice, nor ſuch a Number; not Preaching, nor any other Exerciſe of Religion, can be notorious in it ſelf, that it is ſuch a Fact, but to them that are preſent at it. Such Exerciſe may be, and yet not differing from the manner of the Church, by its own Evidence, but to him or them to whom it is evident upon the place, or by Oath of two Witneſſes. But why ſhall two infamous Witneſſes carry it from the contrary Teſtimony of more than two, and more credible? Becauſe it is for the King? No Lie, nor Perjury, nor Oppreſſion of the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is for the King, but againſt his Honour, Wealth, and Strength. Why will Magiſtrates employ, ſet on, and encourage infamous and known lying Fellows? How can they believe them, that were not Witneſſes, nor preſent in the Meeting from the beginning to the end, but lay skulking at a diſtance, that went ſcouting up and down; that took Names upon Truſt and Hear-ſay; and that cannot tell the Text, nor one Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Sermon, nor who the Preacher was?</p>
            <p>Here Regard is to be had to the Credibility of Perſons on both ſides: Are there not as honeſt, juſt, conſciencious Perſons as Informers? I hope, I know there are; why may not they be believed, and the Parties relieved upon their Appeals? Is it a ſufficient Reaſon, becauſe they ſwear for the King? If for the King as a Party, then Judges judg between Party and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102446:52"/>Party, and in doing Juſtice againſt the King's Cauſe as a Party, they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh his Throne as a King, and thereby act for him. If it be for the King's Profit, it ſuppoſes the Right to lie on his Side firſt, or elſe it is no Profit, but a Worm in his Exchequer. What other Reaſon is there why theſe Witneſſes muſt be believed? Is it becauſe they ſwear poſitively in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative? Becauſe ſome that conſtrue Things in their favour, do take this for a Rule, that a Negative cannot be proved, therefore their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Swearing cannot be diſproved? I do think it worthy a few Words to explain it, which may help Mens Underſtanding: therefore I ſay, A Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative cannot be proved, becauſe it is grounded (pardon the Word) upon a Non-entity; that is, There is no ſuch thing; therefore ſuch a thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be affirmed and proved. Truth is the poſitive in Being and Reality, and therefore Truth can only be affirmed. In a Contradictory, one Side can only be true. If one Man ſwear a Lie never ſo poſitively, he poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſwears a Negative or a Privative: He that ſwears the Truth, tho it be contrary to an affirmative Falſhood, or Lie, ſwears a Poſitive. Now when an Informer, or any other Witneſs, ſwears poſitively ſo and ſo, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwears the contrary, the Judg and Jury, (who are Judges of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) muſt know, that he that ſwears Truth, he only ſwears the Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and the other the Negative; and therefore in this caſe they muſt uſe their Reaſon, to compare the Credit of the Perſons that ſwear on both Sides; and if there be an equality in them, they muſt have regard to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and find out what Evidence they can. Let Juries take heed of the Guilt of a <hi>falſe Verdict,</hi> when they are tempted and deceived, that it is for the King: They are to proceed according to the Credit of the Evidence, and then it is for the King, when they proceed according to Truth: Then you are Loya! Subjects, when you act according to Law, for Law is the Rule of Loyalty.</p>
            <p>It is too apparent, that too many now do ſtudy, by what Laws Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants may be brought into Trouble; as <hi>Lactantius</hi> reports, that <hi>Domitius</hi> (<hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Honoured Sirs,</hi> you have a Law, and Laws; keep ſtrictly to them, and do not your ſelves tranſgreſs them: You have Laws againſt others, keep to thoſe Laws, and you will not give Diſſenters ſuch juſt cauſe to complain, as they have. You have Laws, and you have a Religion too, in great danger from the Execution of them at this time, and in the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, if the Judgment of a great part of them, who had Ability to judg, and Power to declare their Judgments be of any value; You
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102446:53"/>have a Law, but keep to your Places, leſt you give great advantage to them that complain of illegal Sufferings.</p>
            <p>Many of you do not like the Laws, but beſides the Law, there is a Penalty, and an hundred Pounds will make a Hole in ſome Juſtices Eſtates, eſpecially in Towns and Cities, who are Tradeſmen: But keep ſtrictly to the Laws, to theſe Laws, and you may venture your Penalty. If you were not too forward, or too fearful, the Informers would fear to come to your Houſes, as Men afraid to be ſent to the Houſe of Correction, or a Goal; and you may eaſier defeat them, than they recover a Forfeiture upon you, with all their Arts of Falſhood and Perjury: But if you value your Forfeiture, above the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, in a great part of it, how will you be able co ſuffer the Loſs of all againſt Popery?</p>
            <p>And laſtly; Conſider ſeriouſly the manifold Manifeſtations of God in theſe Things: The Judgments of God are rarely and ſeldom executed, becauſe of his Patience and Mercy; but they are ſometimes, that they may be noted, and that Men may fear. <hi>The Lord is known by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he executeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may be called <hi>Fanaticiſin,</hi> and vain Obſervations of weak and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Minds: But as it is a Contempt of God, not to obſerve his Providences, and his Judgments; ſo Chriſtians in all Ages, have made and given Obſervations of God's Hand ſtretched out againſt them that have perſecuted his People, or helped forward their Affliction.</p>
            <p>You know how unwillingly <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was drawn to deliver our Saviour. Who ever accounted <hi>Ger. Jo. Voſſius</hi> below the moſt learned of his Age?

But how common a Practice hath it been to indict peaceable Men and Women, and bind them to the Behaviour, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Chriſtian Exerciſes?—God hath ſpoken by Wars with a Nation of our own Profeſſion, by Peſtilence, by many dreadful Fires, by raging Fevers, and other Diſeaſes not commonly known, in which God hath not long debated with wretched Mortals, but taken them away ſuddenly. He hath contended by great Decays in Mens Eſtates, by hideous Darkneſs, by ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching conſuming Heat; and laſtly, by pouring down immoderate Rains, (will neither Fire melt us, nor Rain ſoften us, no, not ſo much as into one Faſt?) And is this a ſign that God is attended to, and his Voice underſtood, and his Warning taken, that the Meuths of his Servants ſhall be ſtopp'd? And what tho God hath remembred Mercy, in giving us great Plenty, after both exceſſive Heat and immoderate Rains; doth not he expect to be entreated, and that we ſhould amend our Ways?

And do you think this is the way to live long upon Earth, and bring down a Bleſſing upon your ſelves, and your Poſterity, to diſcountenance or to extirpate the Profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion? Could but the Dead adviſe you, they would adviſe you to be truly pious, and piouſly zealous, to encourage them that mind the Way to Heaven, and to hedg up their Way with Thorns, that tranſgreſs, and are extravagant out of the Ways of God: They would tell you, that many that keep the other Side of the Thorn-Hedg, (to uſe the Words of an eminent Guide in that Way) do meet at the Journey's End. But the Dead ſpeak not; and it will be too late, your Work will be done, before you can go to adviſe with them. O hearken to the Voice of God in his Word, in his Judgments, in your many Examples,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102446:54"/>and in your own Conſciences! Can you diſcern a Judgment of God, when you ſee it at another Man's Door? Muſt it come in at your own Doors? muſt it come up Stairs? muſt it come to your Bed-Chamber? and muſt it hinder the Succeſs of all Phyſicians upon you, and follow you to your Graves, before you take a reverent Notice of it.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you be not diſpleaſed with me for telling you what I think: The Curſe of diſobedient Children, the Curſe of Swearing and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and many other Impieties; the Curſe of Poverty, and Neceſſity to mangle, if not to alienate Eſtates, comes into many Houſes, becauſe they would not have the Bleſſing of <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> by entertaining the Ark of God: And do not you in your Conſciences know, (if ever you do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect) that they only, or for the moſt part, who have bent their Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Nonconformiſts, have made but a Pretence of the Church, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe their natural Diſguſt, or cloſe Diſpleaſure againſt the Practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligicus Duties: For till a Man's own Heart be perſuaded and converted to God, he doth not well digeſt Religion in any other; and indeed he can no more love it in others, than condemn himſelf; for he muſt needs condemn the Neglect in himſelf, that commends the Practice in another. Have you known the moſt pious and ſober Perſons, of the moſt unſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reaſon, to be forward and eager? Have you not traced the Pipes, that have conveyed the Oil of Intereſt to feed this burning Zeal? Name but one Man that hath ſtood upon his own Legs, without dependance or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; name but one Man, that was wiſe, ſober, temperate, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and conſciencious in the Practice of Religion, in his own Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and in his Family, that was incoherent from ſome in Power for their own worldly Aims, that offered himſelf to this Work: Name but any one that did execute theſe Laws from a pure Heart to pleaſe God, and advance his Honour; and for that one, you may ſuſpect many others, if not know your ſelves, to act from a private, worldly, if not revengeful Spirit.</p>
            <p>Have you not known that Men have taken their Aims and Meaſures from the Wills of ſome in higher place? and that have cried up, or beaten down Religion, as it hath opened their way, or ſtood in it to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned Projects? The Spring of theſe violent Motions is as apparent as the <hi>Gnomen</hi> of the Dial, to the Eyes of all thoſe that ſee what time of day it is. I have been ſparing of Names, becauſe I would not offend; yet for warning and example ſake, be pleaſed to obſerve what they have done and been, that have gone before you: Do you take your ſelves to be more eminently Loyal than all that are laid aſide? Do you think it will be a meritorious Service to ſuppreſs Diſſenters, elſe you can be no Friends to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> no Sons of the Church? But who is the <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or which is the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102446:55"/>Church, for whoſe ſake Proteſtants muſt be undone? Not the King, nor the Church of <hi>England.</hi> This is your time of acting your parts. There is as great Reaſon to be ſhie and tender in Execution of Laws againſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, as to be ſevere and zealous for other Laws. Take heed! for God is concerned, you, and your Families and Poſterities concerned; and as you muſt account to God, abuſe not the Power given you, to ſerve any Man's Pleaſure, or your own corrupt Affections. Take Example by ſome of as mean Parts as Eſtates, who have been recommended to Power by for their Forwardneſs in ſuch Services as theſe, and have not had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Comfort of living in their own Houſes, yet have been buſy in opening, and breaking into, and rifling their religious Neighbours; and by others of large Eſtates and Fortunes, who eat their Commons not dreſs'd in their own Kitchins, and have not common Liberty, but what they ask leave, and pay for. Take warning by ſome, who have run but a very ſhort Race and Courſe in the purſuit of Diſſenters, and have left none of their Children to ſucceed them in their Power. Take the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of them, who have ſeen the Hand of God ſtretched out againſt them and their Families, and whoſe Conſciences have applied the meaning of it in the Death of their Children, both of their <hi>Reubens</hi> and <hi>Benjamins;</hi> and that have not proſpered in this World, but have fled, and hid, lived and died in a Place that hath no Mark of Honour upon it, but that it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to be the Kings. <hi>Elias</hi> was as great a Fanatick, and Diſturber of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> as any Nonconformiſt now: Chuſe you, Noble Sirs, to be <hi>Obadiah's,</hi> rather to hide the Prophets of the Lord by Fifty, than be either a Captain of a Fifty, or one of the Fifty, that go to take the Prophets: Every one thoſe unhappy Captains had an Authority as high as yours can be: But <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badia</hi> could diſtinguiſh between a Prophet and a Rebel, a faithful Preacher, and a State-Diſturber, and of all the Captains he was preſerved. And ſo I do heartily pray, that you may be in your Spheres a Terror to evil Doers, and a Praiſe to them that do well; and ſo Death and Judgment will be no Terror to you, and you ſhall have Praiſe of God: Spare no Teacher of Sedition, but honour them that fear the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I crave leave to write a few Words to my Brethren in the Holy Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reverend and beloved Fathers and Brethren,</hi> I am not unſenſible of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs to write to you, both in reſpect of my own Inability, and your Prejudice againſt me. I fear my Charity to my Reverend and worthy Brethren the Nonconformiſts, have loſt me much of yours. I am ſorry that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102446:55"/>any have ſo little of this Oil, that they have not enough for them and me too: But I will adventure to open my Mind a little to you, tho it be tho leſs. I do humbly conceive the Word of Reconciliation is committed to us, and the Holy-Ghoſt is invocated upon us more than once; and thoſe Graces which all Chriſtians have, we ſhould have more abundantly, and ſhould be as well known by that Grace, by which our Saviour would have his Diſciples to be known of all Men, by loving one another, as we are known by our diſtinguiſhing Garbs and Habits. We can ſpeak at large of the Excellency of Love and Peace, and of the ill Effects of Enmity and Diſſention; and repreſent and inveigh againſt Schiſm, as if that were the Sin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, which ſhall never be forgiven in this World, nor in that which is to come, or as if that were the Sin unto Death: And indeed it may be called a <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> in a ſence, becauſe it is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Charity and Peace, and deſtructive of the Life of Saints, which doth much conſiſt in their Communion. But were we impartial, we ſhould as warmly admoniſh our own Hearts, to take heed of Schiſmatical Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and excommunicate them from within us, as admoniſh and caſt out others that differ from us. Is there not ſome Fondneſs for our own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Self-Love in the Praiſe of Unity, and Reproof of Schiſm? For moſt of the Diſcourſes I have heard or read of late Years upon this great Subject, have been to condemn or cenſure all that differ from us. We would have all Men think, not only charitably, but well and honourably of us: but if we have any Charity for them that are out, we are very careful that it be done in ſecret, and without ſound of Trumpet. I am far from extending this to all the Conforming Brethren, but to them, and them only, who from Miſ-information received an obſtinate Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or Policy, are profuſe in the Expence of Words and Paſſions. We do take it extreme ill from ſome Nonconformiſts, that they cenſure and ſpeak ill of us, that they revile, and render us as ſcandalous and odious, as ready to decline and apoſtatize; but really are not the hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them matched,<note place="margin">See the ſecond Sermon of the Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>Cork,</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective Preaching.</note> if not beaten out of the Field? I may be thought to have an Intimacy with them, and a Partiality for them, whereas my Acquaintance is very little; but as far as it doth extend, I muſt do them this Juſtice, that they are of a very loving healing, and uniting Spirit. I have heard them ſpeak very well of good Conformiſts, and as free to acknowledg the Grace of God in them, as in thoſe of their own Perſuaſion, and as ready to hold Terms of Friendſhip with us. Have not we given them as great Offence, by doing what they cannot do, as they have given us, by not doing that we have done? they have loſt by our Compliance, but we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> loſt by their Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:102446:56"/>except, as they are often told, we loſe by their means among the People, but we gain among the Princes by it; and do we love them ſo ill, that we would not have the People love them? Alas! what a peckled Bird is a Nonconformiſt in a Princes Court, and in moſt noble Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, at a publick Meeting! What! is a little Popularity grudg'd them? I am grieved to think what a Crime it is to be conſciencious. Certainly, if they are not conſciencious, they have not common Senſe; and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Jeers and Sarcaſins with which they have been treated, have not ſufficiently ſet out their Folly, if they ſuffered great Loſſes, to gain the cold Breath of Popularity, which would ſooner ſtarve than refreſh them. Who ſhould be ſo compaſſionate, courteous, officious, loving and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able towards them, as we who are Miniſters? Who ſhould better know the Darkneſs and Weakneſs, the various Workings of the Mind, than we? Who ſhould more candidly uſe them that diſſent from us, than we, who know our many Diſſents from our ſelves, at ſeveral times, and the ſame Points? Who ſhould allow more to the ſcrupulous than we, who know the Weakneſs of our own Light, and aſcribe much to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience? Conſcience is no Sovereign, but Conſcience is next and immediatly under Chriſt the King. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſubject to Miſtakes,<note place="margin">It is ſuſpicious, that ſome Mens Conformity is ill built, who ſay, That a Claim of Conſcience is not to be allowed; as if Inferiors were to lay that aſide, or we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to Peace; as if that were to be reſign'd up to Rulers.</note> but its Judgment is of higheſt Authority next under God, and to be controlled by none but him. It is Hypocriſy and Impiety to pretend it; and it is too great a Boldneſs, and Intruſion into the Throne of God, to judg that they do but pretend Conſcience: And very ill Service is done to Chriſtianity, and great Encouragement is given to Impiety, by ſome Mens arraigning Diſſenters for a bare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Conſcience, by making the diſſolute act as ſecurely, as if there were really no ſuch Power as that of Conſcience. Is it not a Word too common, <hi>Hang 'em, hang 'em, there is none good, no Truſt to be given to Men that pretend to Conſcience?</hi> Who ſhould better underſtand what Unity and Conſent is neceſſary between Chriſtians, and what Condeſcenſion and Forbearance is neceſſary? Who ſhould better underſtand the differing Practices of ancient Churches, than we? And that there is no perfect Unity, till we come to perfect Light and Grace? We ſhould know that there are hard things in Conformity. Subſcription and Conformity is the eaſieſt thing in the World, if there were no more required, than that they will not rebell, but ſupport the Government, and be peaceable under it: If this be all, tell them pleinly, in theſe or like plain Words, and then ſee if they will refuſe.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102446:56"/>But to impoſe upon us Maximes of State, the Determination of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, is to bring many Men into the Clouds, tho others get near the Sun, and have Light enough to read their meaning. We ſhould know the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a Scholar, the Charge of Studies, the Neceſſities of Families, and how harſh a thing it is to be too much indebted to Charity ſince all things have ceaſed to be common. We ſhould upon many Conſiderations commiſerate them, and their Families. We ſhould be hoſpitable, and not forgetful to entertain Strangers. How comes it then to paſs, that it is ſuch a Crime in ſome Mens Eyes, to be courteous to a diſſenting Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and his very Neighbourhood is become intolerable, eſpecially if he preach the Word?</p>
            <p>In a word, as I ſaid before, we that preach the <hi>Word of Reconciliation,</hi> ſhould be of reconcileable Spirits and Tempers. Proud and erroneous Phariſees were given to caſt out of Synagogues. It is a Sectarian Spirit, to make Sects, or to uſe a ſound Chriſtian as if he were a Sectary. The Spirit of Sanctification is neceſſary to all that will be ſaved, and for us more than others: We declare we have received that Spirit before Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, when the Holy-Ghoſt is invocated, and we are ſent with Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from him.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to bring to your Minds the excellent Words of <hi>Cyprian. — Idcirco &amp; in columba venit Spiritus Sanctus, ſimplex animal &amp; loetum, non felle amarum, non morſibus ſaevum, non unguium laceratione violentum: Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia humana diligere, unius domus conſortium noſſe, cum generant, ſimul filios edere; cum commeant, volantibus invicem cohaerere; communi converſatione vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ſuam degere, oris oſculo concordiam pacis agnoſcere, lege circa omnia una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimitatis implere. — Quid facit in pectore Chriſtiano luporum feritas, &amp; eanum rabies, &amp; venenum lethale ſerpentum, &amp; cruenta ſaevitia beſtiarum?</hi> — He ſpeaks of the Catholick Church, in that excellent Book, <hi>De Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Prelatorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Barbarity and Cruelty rages in the Wilderneſs without the Church. How unbecoming a Scholar, yea, a Man? a Miniſter, yea, a Chriſtian, is it, to imbitter the Lives of them that are caſt out of their Churches; and Houſes, and Free-Holds, and caſt down to be trampled under foot? To exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Magiſtrates againſt them! Is it to our Honour to put on the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Spurs? Is Whiſpering and Backbiting a Grace in us? Are Invectives, Sermons? I do not marvel that ſome Men do not pray before their Sermons, when I conſider what their Sermons have been; but do much more marvel, that after their Sermons they have repeated an excellent Prayer out of the Common-Prayer, <hi>That the Word might ſink into our Hearts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:102446:57"/>
There are two Things which are taken exceeding ill from you, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Gentlemen, and Members of our Church: Your medling with State-Affairs in the Pulpit, and your exciting the Magiſtrates to proſecute Proteſtants; by which you do not ſave your ſelves, nor gain others. Have not ſome of you driven away, and loſt your own Auditors, by your Invectives againſt Proteſtant Nonconformiſts of longer ſtanding in the Church of Chriſt, and that have gone through thoſe Trials, and ſtood faſt, which you have not felt as yet, and whom you ought to honour as Fathers and Brethren? It can never be a comfortable Day to you, if you lived to ſee them all uſed as you would have them uſed. How unworthy a thing is it in a Miniſter, to go next way to a Magiſtrate, and inform and incenſe him againſt your Brethren, (ſo you ſhould eſteem them) for a private Diſcourſe, which had nothing of Danger, but ſome pleaſantneſs in it! Some have been ſenſible of this afterwards, and aſhamed. How zealous an Act is it in a Miniſter, to importune a Magiſtrate, time after time, to drive Miniſter out of his own Family, out of a Town, or into a Priſon? Muſt that Man be clear in his own Soul, that cannot abide the Neighbourhood of a Nonconformiſt, becauſe he thinks himſelf condemned by his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Conſtancy? Whether was the more Chriſtian Act and Temper, to moleſt a Nonconformiſt living, or to beg his Pardon dying, for an unfriendly, uncharitable, perfidious Carriage? How uncomfortable is it for a Miniſter, to diſturb, and procure the Puniſhment of a few diſſatisfied Perſons, by which they are cut off from him, and grow and propagate? They encreaſe, and he grows more diſcontented and troubleſom, and in his declining Age outlives their Love, and his own Honour, not among them alone; and to ſink and fall in the Eſteem and Honour, which once he had out of the Confines of his own Pariſh; and his Labours, once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, are become fruitleſs. I do not know, that kindling of Fires is any part of the Office of an Evangelical Prieſt. I conceal Names, and proceed no further.</p>
            <p>Some of you are zealous for the Laws, for all, and for a full Obedience of all Perſons to all Laws: But, my Brethren, as going to Law is the laſt Remedy to be uſed by an injured Perſon; ſo <hi>omnia prius tentanda,</hi> by us, in Caſes wherein we may appeal to, or call in the Aſſiſtance of the Law. Have we ſtated the Differences? have we argued with the Spirit of Love with them? have we prayed to God for them? Have we given no juſt Offence, either by bitterneſs or negligence? Have we become all things to them, to gain them? After all means, have we exerciſed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance? and begun with the firſt Offices of Love, and then riſen higher and higher? But as ſoon as Men come into a divided Pariſh, to preſent them, or complain to Juſtices, is to begin where we ſhould not end without
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102446:57"/>extreme unwillingneſs and trouble. Our Maſter never caught us this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Proceeding. To correct by Warrants, is not edifying and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting. It is commonly ſaid, That Executioners of the Law are to act, and not to judg, or uſe their own Diſcretion: No! why then what's the reaſon that wiſe and diſcreet Men are at any time put into Office?</p>
            <p>I have anſwered what Objections I met with before; I ſhall but touch one common Grievance, which is, (beſides the general Accuſation of Schiſm and Separation, and other Matters of Debate) that either ſome of your Pariſhioners go abroad to hear, or ſome of the Nonconformiſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers preach in your Pariſhes. In this Caſe there are abundance of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that aggravate or diminiſh, and by conſequence aſter it. If the Nonconformiſt Miniſter be an able good Man, I think we ſhould be glad and thankful for his Pains, and live (as in ſome very great Places ſome eminent Conformiſts and Nonconformiſts do) in great Love and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and both are edified in Love. You know, St. <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced that Chriſt was preached, tho out of Envy to him. But hath Neceſſity brought Preachers among us, or carried away careful Souls from us? then who is moſt to blame? Suppoſe there were two Churches in your Town, you are not grieved that all hear you not in that Caſe. I know the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Pariſh-Bounds, both for Miniſters and People, eſpecially where Pariſhes are thick; and People ſhould be tender how they leave a painful profitable Pariſh-Miniſter ſent unto them: And I have heard, ſome Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſt Preachers have perſuaded People to hear them; and Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſt Hearers, that could not in Conſcience forſake good Men, if they had ſuch in their Pariſhes. Others are of another Temper, weak, and ſubject to Paſſions. But in this Caſe, as I ſhould labour conſcienciouſly to be a profitable Miniſter; ſo I ſhould not be a Hindrance to the greater Profit of Souls elſewhere; I ſhould not think them to be loſt to me, that are gained to Chriſt by another Miniſter. But this Complaint is made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſome Conforming Miniſters, that they draw too. The Anſwer was home and blunt, of a Conforming Preacher, either given or ſent to a Neighbour-Miniſter, who was aggrieved his People left him, and went to the Neighbour-Miniſter: <hi>I preached them hither, and let him preach them home again, if he will.</hi> If our Hearts were ſet upon our Work, and if God's Glory was uppermoſt, and Self-denial nouriſhed, theſe things would be better born. The Diſſenters are either peaceable in their Diſſents, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in their different Opinions, ſincere in their Ways; or they are of a Sectarian Spirit: To the one the Spirit of Meekneſs, Love, Forbearance, is beſt ſuited, and we may live together with Comfort and Edification; to the other, Severity is an improper Cure, for it makes him the more a Sectary. We are to gain, and to gather, and to uſe all Means that are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102446:58"/>proper, and effective of that End. Are there not in all our Pariſhes, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, profane, careleſs Sectaries from God, and his holy Body? What Imprudence would it be, to bring them all under Fines and Troubles? They ſhould be a greater Grief to us, undoubtedly, than honeſt ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Sauls, that ſeek the way to pleaſe God. If Nonconformity be ſuch an Eye-ſore, let us take heed that we do not make Nonconformiſts, and not blame them ſo much as our ſelves, if they ſeek to mend themſelves elſewhere. It is certain, <hi>High Conformiſts made Nonconformiſts, in</hi> 1662. And it is too evident, that Conformiſts do make many ſtill. I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> had been alive in our Days, he would never have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded the Magiſtrate to make ſuch Laws, nor any of the Fathers before him, much leſs the holy Apoſtles; their Salutations expreſſed the Large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts, and their Catholick Love to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> among whom were great Diviſions; to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> among whom were ſome very erroneous: So did their Benedictions; <hi>Peace be to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Love, with Faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Epheſ. 6.23. <hi>And Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jeſus in Sincerity.</hi> verſ. 2. But to love the Nonconformiſts into Silence, into Poverty, into Diſgrace, into Bonds, is a Love not known to be numbred among the Characters and Signs of Chriſtian Love. If Chriſt died for them, if any of them love Chriſt in Sincerity, love them better for Chriſt's ſake; and let not Conformity be a neceſſary Condition of private Charity, as well as of Miniſterial Liberty and Maintenance: (I know it is not ſo to all, ſome have Hearts and Hands extended, but) I ſpeak to them whoſe Zeal, or ſomething elſe, makes them ſtrait and rigorous. Would you love them if they would conform? Why do you not love ſome that have conformed, but not above Conformity, after your Pattern and Example? Do you ſay, it would not trouble you if the Laws were ſmooth'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed, but while they are in force, it is fit, and for the Honour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they ſhould be executed? But is it likely that thoſe Laws will ever be abated, by your means at leaſt, which you that ſtile your ſelves the Church do like ſo well, as to call and preſs for their Execution? Why have you ſo little Honour for thoſe Noble Gentlemen in Parliament, that would have diſannull'd them? Some ſay, let Authority make what Laws they will, they muſt be obeyed. If you thought more gentle Laws would do better, why do you ſo much approve of theſe? If theſe be ſo very good and fit, are we ever like to hear of more moderate, if you can hinder them? Your Zeal is for Uniformity, as well as Government: Why may not another Act be as grateful to you, as this Force? and a new Uniformity as deſirable as the old? Then you ſay, 'Tis dangerous to alter Laws and Eſtabliſhment. You are zealous againſt Diſorder, that is, to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:102446:58"/>ſay plainly, you would preſerve Order, by cutting us aſunder into great Diſtractions. Ruines before the Gates of a Royal Palace, is an unpleaſing offenſive Sight. The Ruines of the Nonconformiſts lie at your very Gates: agree with Surveyors, and wiſe Builders, to raiſe out of the Ruines a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Fabrick, for Peace and Love to dwell in: If not, know you aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there are thoſe at work, that will lay you as low as you have done them. And who can be aſſured of the contrary, but that our holy and honeſt, our good and farthful Brethren, have perfum'd, air'd, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Common-Goals againſt our going in? which if we ſuffer, I wiſh we may have Grace to endure as they have done; as I am confident we ſhall be more of the ſame Spirit with them in ſuch a Caſe, than now you are.</p>
            <p>It cannot be blotted out, that the Clergy and Cardinal of <hi>Lorain</hi> did inſtigate and inflame the Magiſtrates; O that this were a Blot only in Popiſh Martyrologies! How alien is this from the Mind of our Lord? from the Temper of Chriſtianity? And how unlike a Courſe to perſuade Diſſenters, or to quiet the Church? Let this go among the Vertues of the Phariſees, Papiſts, and Friars. The Words of the Reverend Dr. <hi>Burnett,</hi> of the beſt and worſt of Clergy-Men, will not encreaſe his Honour, or procure him love from many of us. I'll make bold to repeat a few of them: <hi>It is obſervable, the beſt Clergy Men have been the moſt gentle to thoſe that differed from them. But the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy, who know that a good Cauſe may be ſpoiled, but is not likely to prevail in their Hands, and will not trouble themſelves with the laborious Methods of conquering Errors, are always apt to extreme and cruel Courſes, ſince they know they muſt prevail with theſe, or none at all.</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Rights of Princes, <hi>pag.</hi> 257, 258.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle's Wiſh, <hi>I would they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> falls ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where elſe, and is not to the purpoſe it is often produced for. We that are commanded, if we love Chriſt; to feed his Lambs, are not to ſet any on to worry ſtraying Sheep. The Holy-Ghoſt is often invocated upon us, and therefore except the frequent Invocations be in vain, we are to breath out from that, and not another Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">III. A Word to <hi>Informers,</hi> to whom I have but little to ſay at preſent.</p>
            <p>How unſavoury is the Memory of <hi>Gardiner</hi> and <hi>Bonner!</hi> the former a cunning Informer, both Inſtigators and Perſecutors. An Informer, in the pureſt Sence of <hi>Index,</hi> is a naughty Man turn'd honeſt, when he doth it out of abhorrence of evil Counſels, and Conſcience of Duty.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102446:59"/>for Gain, have been branded amongſt the worſt of Men. When they have run from one way of Wickedneſs to another, from Avarice and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, to ſell their Souls, Truth, Modeſty, and the little of Humanity that is continued with the Face and Shape, then they are to be abominated by wiſe, juſt, good, and merciful Men. The Days are evil, when ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Evils walk about by Day-light. We read of them in <hi>Plautus</hi>'s <hi>Perſa. Sat.

            <p>All the Threatnings of Torments could not move St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to inform the Proconſul of his Brethren in <hi>Carthage.</hi> After other trying Diſcourſes, <hi>Paternus</hi> the Proconſul asked him, <hi>Tell me where are thoſe Presbyters which are faid to be in this City?</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> anſwered, <hi>Ye have well ordained, and like Men, that there ought to be no Informers, therefore they ought not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by me, but you may find them out; and becauſe ye have judged, that no Man ſhall accuſe himſelf.</hi> The Proconful anſwered, <hi>But I will tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thee, but I will find them out by thee.</hi> The Saint of God anſwered, <hi>They ſhall not be deſtroyed by me.</hi> The Proconſul anſwered, <hi>It is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Princes, that the Chriſtians keep no Conventicles, nor go to the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-Places of the Martyrs; and if any Man tranſgreſs, he muſt be puniſhed with the Sword.</hi> The Saint of God anſwered, <hi>Do as thou art commanded.

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>I Expect to be told of the Sufferings of the Loyal Clergy in the Time of War: I have diſtinguiſhed between a Time of War and Peace, of doleful Havock, and Security and Law; but it is not obſerved. I ſay now, that theſe Miniſters I have mentioned in the foregoing Treatiſe have been Loyal Perſons, and in the Times of Uſurpation ventured their Lives and Eſtates for the King's happy Return. I know no Man ſo diſingenuous, as to envy the Care that hath been to preſerve Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſton</hi> (a Papiſt) from the Laws, for his good Service about the King, in his Eſcape. But no ſuch Care was taken of Mr. <hi>Parſons,</hi> Mr. <hi>Heywood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who was in the Tower when the King was called in, who ventured their Lives and Eſtates for the King with Sir <hi>George Booth.</hi> Biſhop <hi>Walton</hi> would ſpeak civilly to Mr. <hi>Cook,</hi> but told him, he muſt conform, or he could not help him. Now many of the Loyal Clergy were out of Livings or Employments, that did not take their Eaſe, or enjoy a ſtudious Retirement? How many that loved Preaching, or did
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102446:60"/>cleave to their Flocks, that did not enjoy ſome Liberty and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I could reckon up many that had Livings in the City, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in Churches without any Let; as Dr. <hi>Hall,</hi> (afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi>) Dr. <hi>Ball,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wild,</hi> (late Biſhop in <hi>Ireland</hi>) Dr. <hi>Hardy,</hi> Dr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> Dr. <hi>Peirſon,</hi> (now Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi>) Dr. <hi>Moſſome,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farringdon,</hi> with many more, beſides Abundance in every County. How many of them fled on choice, left their Places, even in the King's Quarters? I could name ſome of them, when I was a Boy; and now I live where a Miniſter did voluntarily abſent forty Months before he appeared, and in the mean time the Patron preſented.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, <hi>O. Cromwell,</hi> and his Officers, did once, upon ſome provocation of a pretended Plot againſt him, by a Proclamation prohibit their Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, keeping Schools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But by the Interceſſion of that excellent Man Arch-Biſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> they had their Liberty again, and preached, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed their Places all the Time of the Uſurpation; and thoſe that were kept out of their Livings, had the Fifths allowed them. I ſpeak not this to excuſe the Evils of thoſe Times, but to ſhew that the Loyal Clergy found ſome Mercy and Pity even from Uſurpers; and ſome of them have ingenuouſly confeſſed, that they received great Kindneſs from ſome in Power then: And ſhall not we now exceed them in Mercy? Does it not become us to act according to the Chriſtian Law, to <hi>overcome Evil with Good?</hi> and according to the Law of the Land, (the Act of Oblivion) in not reviving the Memory of the Evils of former Days, to the detriment of any Perſon or Perſons?</p>
            <p>But now ſuch a Storm is raiſed, that is ready to carry away not only the Goods, but the Perſons of the Nonconformiſts: I know not the Reaſon, unleſs it be becauſe they were too zealous for the Bill of Excluſion. Indeed Sedition and Rebellion is pretended, that they are Enemies to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that they are acting the old Game of <hi>Forty One,</hi> and <hi>Forty Eight.</hi> Let theſe things be proved, and then let them ſuffer; I plead not for any ſuch.</p>
            <p>Nay, Moderation, and moderate Divines of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are become now hateful and expoſed, and eſpecially if any of us dare be ſo <hi>Bold</hi> as to plead for Moderation towards Diſſenters; and in ſo doing we are repreſented as Enemies to the Church, and threatned to be caſt our. 'Tis ſaid, we have reflected on our preſent Clergy, when it is only ſuch of the Clergy as are over-zealous and fiery, and hinder the Union of Proteſtants. <hi>For if</hi> Phaeton (as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Iren.</hi> ſays) <hi>drive the Chariot of the Sun, the World will be ſoon on Fire: I mean ſuch in the Church, whoſe Brains, like the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicorn's, run out into the length of the Horn; ſuch who have more Fury than Zeal, and yet more Zeal than Knowledg or Moderation.</hi>

               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:102446:60"/>
The Generality of our preſent Clergy are great Admirers of Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> and thoſe that adhered to him; and yet Mr. <hi>Hammond L'Eſtrange</hi> (one that was a zealous Church-man, and as keen againſt the Presbyterians as his Name-ſake) hath ſaid more of him and them, than any of the moderate Divines now have, or dare to ſay of the preſent Clergy. <hi>Viz.</hi>

            <p>— <hi>His Zeal to Order</hi> (meaning Arch-Biſhop <hi>Land</hi>) <hi>carried him thus far,</hi> (that is, to put the Canons in Execution) <hi>tranſported him a little too far: The Communion-Table, which formerly ſtood in the midſt of the Church or Chancel, he enjoined it to be placed at the Eaſt End, upon a graduated advance of Ground, with the Ends inverted, and a Woodden Traverſe of Rails before it, to keep Prophanation off, to which Rails all Communicants were to reſort. Theſe things were decent and comely in Contemplation, and had been ſo in Practice, had they been within the Rule of the Church Directions; but being Anomalous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, and ſo ſeverely urged, many became thereupon preciſe, and ſeparated themſelves into factious Sidings; nor was this a Schiſm of an ordinary Size, but grew to that proceſs, to that degree, as, to ſpeak in the Primitive Mode, Altar was erected againſt Altar, that is, one Biſhop impugned and oppoſed another: For the Biſhop of</hi> Lincoln (<hi>being affronted by one</hi> Titly, <hi>Vicar of</hi> Grantham) <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a Tract under a concealed Name, poſitively aſſerting therein,</hi> That the holy Table anciently did in the Primitive Times, and ought ſo in ours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Dictates of our Church, ſtand <hi>in gremio,</hi> and Nave of the Quire. <hi>And as the Arch-Biſhop, whilſt he ſo vehemently purſued Order, did a little out-run Authority; ſo was he unhappy in thoſe he did employ, as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Subordinates under him, ſome whereof endeavoured to ſuper-induct many Things, as Will-Worſhip of their own, and which came within a</hi> Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Line of Popery: <hi>Nor were they blameleſs in their Lives, ſome being vitious even to Scandal, nor of ſo meek and humble Behaviour as was to be wiſh'd, but inſolent at a rate ſo intolerable, as one was bold to ſay, He hoped to live to ſee the Day, when a Miniſter ſhall be as good a Man as any upſtart Jack-Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in</hi> England. <hi>To ſuch a height of Infatuation had a petty Blaze of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Honour elevated this high Flyer, who in lieu of thoſe frolick Days he looked to ſee, lived to ſee that very Hierarchy extirpated, and lived to ſee himſelf deplumed of all his Pomp. Theſe Exorbitancies of thoſe Sons of</hi> Eli <hi>from the Rules of Ethicks, created a very great Diſguſt againſt them; and many well enough af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to their Empire, did exceedingly blame their Imperioſity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
